 of favourite takeaways and amount of Indian restaurants in Canada between 1960 and 2015.

On the first chart
 it can be noticed, that Canadians’ the most favourite takeaway is Chinese food (34% of participants eat there) and the least favourite are Mexican, Japanese and Greek in the list of specified types (only 1% of participants eat there for each type). The second diagram shows the increase of amount of Indian restaurants from 1960 to 2007 up to approximately 9000 points and fluctuates
 near 9000 from 2007 to 2015, got to

One serious problem that can arise from open
 space design of buildings is that it makes people feel lack
 of privacy. In open Spaces, an employee's work screen may be seen by the next desk, and even when he or she goes to the bathroom, others will notice. This kind of non-privacy environment sometimes also produces pressure, people in

 lack of visual privacy in the environment is easy to produce excessive exposure discomfort.

Another issue is that open
 office is
 easy to spread of 
illness. Open offices bring employees closer together and make the office environment denser, which can increase the spread of bacteria and increase the risk of employees contracting infectious diseases. Due to environmental factors, employees working in open office environments may have a weakened immune system due to increased stress, which makes employees more prone to headaches and respiratory problem

stories which have good things like people always have kindness, generous

True happiness is a complex and subjective concept that cannot be solely attributed to money .While financial stability can provide comfort and opportunities ,it does not guarantee lasting fulfillment 
.Many people find happiness through non - materialistic factors such as meaningful relationships ,personal growth ,and a sense of purpose .

These intrinsic values often contribute more significantly to overall well - being
 than wealth alone.However ,it's important to acknowledge that financial security can alleviate stress and provide access to resources that enhance quality of life.For example  ,a person living in 
a minimalist lifestyle with limited financial resources may pricritize
 meaningful connection 

Therefore ,while money can play a role in facilitating  happiness ,its significance is limited compared to the deeper emotional and psychological factors that contribute to a fulfilling life.

  trend since it cause
 millions of massive health issues.From my perspective the most detrimental causes are dehydration  of lands, as well as, crisis
  among the people for drinkable liquid, to overcome the global water 
shorteges 
,government
 should allocate funds to 
beuld  
water tunnels which could provide water locals also put 
strick
  rules for those who waste it

One of the most significant and widespread concerns is the health of the  people, when during the consumption of muddy or unfiltered water, from rivars  
and rain sources, people can contaminate their body with viruses and toxins which will cause raise
 of the temperature in human
 body  and many more.

 In order to resolve this problems 
. I guess that it firstly has to be addressed, perhaps the most effective method of doing it is providing underground water lines,
 because it will provide total use of water for drinking or washing staffs.The next measure would be restriction of overuse of water, as well as, through the fraction of rubbish to the surface of water.

In my conception, I reckon that the best way to getting  
away from global shorteges  
is to create better laws that keeps  
us from schemes and pollution of drinking liquids.

 education is on a significant rise. Consequently, the competition among freshmen to get into the most prestigious universities is tough. As a result
 I lean towards the idea of a contest and I will provide my arguments below.

Over the past decades
 the nations with a high rate of educated persons increased the overall economy of the state. Therefore a huge amount of individuals with a qualified degree are more likely to get into the 
international companies, which restrict
 the number of mankind with unemployment. As a result
 the average salary of workers is a dramatic incline, making the 
life in that particular country way better.

On the other hand, the process of applying to educational institutions gives a strong stress resistance level. Moreover
 the procedure of registering documents to the admission office is punishing. For example, the students are required to demonstrate their academic, non-academic, and financial status, which is not possible for everyone, hence learners in their way of gaining valuable skills on
 their upcoming job places.

First and foremost, saving some part of money
 for the donations will encourage generosity among the people. Therefore, the smiles of joyful kids that
 got their basic needs such as school equipment and uniforms will melt your heart. For example, in most cases, the individuals with a high endowment to the orphanages are spreading goodness all around the world. As a result, open-handnesses

Alternatively, mankind with a huge amount of fortune are
 capable of decreasing the rate of poverty in their countries. Moreover, a small deed is better than a big idleness. For instance, assisting the

#tablets","In today's cutting-edge era, the value of traditional paper-based books is on a gradual decline. However, many parents are prioritising quality time with their children. They are making efforts to pass on the moral values they themselves absorbed from books during their own childhoods.

First and foremost, reading books encourages kids to learn a wide range of vocabulary and language structures. Whereas the 
adults give small lectures to their toddlers in
 a
 concept of stories, kids tend to learn new words to start communicating with the
 surroundings. For example, youngsters at
 the range of age from 4 to 6 inclined
 to use phrases that they had read in fairy-tales
. As a result, the brain
 of juniors is absorbing
 new information via stories read by their parents.

On the other hand, reading fairy-tales
 from proper books affects the emotional intelligence of youth. As shown by recent articles, diving into the literature, emphasise and identify their own feelings towards the characters. In the case of teens at age

First of all, live performance
 of theatrical or music concert
 give exceptional experiences. We can enjoy the actor or singer presenting their art-work
 directly. There is no edited scene or tuned vocal while they performed it in real time
 shows so we would see their talent. Then, watching the artist

 this statement. The supporting reasons will be examined throughout this essay.

 

On the one hand, there are several advantages to the government's high taxes. First of all, the amount of money received will be paid for services and the price of things. However, the cost of maintenance on huge infrastructures could become a deposit for many businesses. Secondly, If the owners of businesses add to in term
 of  the price of food or others, they possibly could decrease their tax deduction in various ways.

On the other hand, the disagreement with tax must spent
 higher than standardised prices brings about many negative effects. Fisrtly
, It is obviously see
 that the 
people's income will be interrupted by their daily life
. Futhermore
, this action totally will impact the economic crisis as

 age world, money and appearance make everything become easier. A part of society believe
 this viewpoint while others think hard work and determination will gain success. This writer is going to discussing
 both views and giving opinions.

First of all, hard-working
 and determination take
 important roles in success. Lack of knowledge can be solved by being determined. For example, students graduated
 from university after learning 
three years could have wage
 as same as citizens worked
 sinxe
 graduated from high school while professions
 learning more than five years in
 university could have a triple wage. Consequently, hardworking
 is a essential skills allow
 individuals to solve complex problems and reach long-term goals.

Another point of view, beauty and money's influence increased dramatically recently. One of the main reason
 is that it is hard to start a business or being
 bublic
 figure without financial sources. For instance, audiences tend to be attracted by pretty celebrities and individuals who leave an impression in their minds, so activists with attractive looks have a huge advantage in the industry.

Taking everything into account,money and appearance can facilitate people in their careers but success only can be achieved through hard work and determination.

I hope this letter finds you in radiant health and high spirit. I'm delighted to know that you've got an admission in
 Gujarat University. I'm writing in response to your letter seeking advice in
 finding accommodation.

When I was a student there, I used to live as a paying guest in a house close to the university. As,
 it has multiple amenities nearby. However, it is difficult to find a
 same house for you because I used to live there eight years ago.

However, you can find a perfect place to live by
 various ways. Firstly, you can talk to your classmates for
 a sharing
 room, staying with your classmate
 could be beneficial for you in various ways. Secondly, you can search online on a marketplace; it has some amazing deals on rents and special discounts for student
. Lastly, you can visit your university area before your semester starts, by doing this, you can visit some rental properties nearby.

Nevertheless, whenever you choose area
 keep these things in mind. First, choose your roommate wisely, because, good company can boost your education, but bad company can destroy your career. Second, do not sign any lease before visiting the property in person. Third, don't select an apartment before confirming availability
 of dinning

These are the suggestions from my side, I hope my suggestions will be helpful. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to contact me.

, such as accounting and waitressing. Therefore, some people think that some 
people think that unemployment is more good to individuals rather that
 work
 in difficult
 job. I totally disagree with stopping hard jobs and live
 without working.

To begin with, the prominent reason why unemployment is
 adverse
 impact to
 people is that it leads people to unsuccessful
 in their careers. As a matter of fact that 
people cannot achieve,
 if they avoid from 
difficulties namely hard and annoying jobs. For example, 75% of young people in Turkey experienced an unsuccessful story with resigning their
 affordable jobs. They were not able to find an easy and comfortable 
jobs. As a result, they could not obtain an achievement in their career life.

Another negative effect of resigning annoying jobs and living without working is that it is due to 
increase
 economic crisis in a country. This is because unemployment
 rate is a very fundamental factor for measuring economic
 situation. Hence, if it growth
 in a state, the economic crisis would increase. For example, in 2020, unemployment
 rate was 
increased by resigning people from their difficulties
 occupations in Egypt. Consequently, the country had a decline in economy.

In conclusion, although living without working is stressful jobs
 is entertainment, still
 it has more potential drawbacks. Reasons
 mentioned above supports
 to continue
 in any jobs
 is more helpful to employers by avoiding from unsuccessful life in the career and influencing to economic crisis.

 some parents think children must decide their own things in life, but I don't think so. Most of the time, kids need some advice from relatives or other people, also, most of the advice will help them grow better.

    First, the key reason may root
 in the fact, some
 children just prefer one type of food, such as hamburgers or chocolates. That is too bad for their health, and only eating one type of food will lead to unbalanced nutrition, moreover, a lot of sweets are not good for their teeth either.

    Second, today in many cities, most children play video games in their free time, for example, when they 
after school or during the weekends. But if they spend more time on the game, it is really unhealth
 for their eyes, somthing
 more serious is they will wear glasses at a very young age, even until old.

    Third, kids usually don't know what is right thing or wrong, they might see some riskly
 plot in a movie, and they maybe
 imitate it in their life, that
 is very hazard
 for them. Most importantly, they will spend many
 time going to the hospital for

 is not fun for them.

 money for early business to make it successful. Appearance cannot be neglected, having a good look gives you many oppurtunities

firmly of 
the 
belief
 that it is impossible to remove the 
teachers from the learning process due to
 a number of reasons.

Firstly, it is undeniable that the personality of a teacher may be more important than curriculum
 itself. The teacher could inspire children by finding the unique key to everyone. Especially in primary school, kids need to learn through gamification and only human teachers can find the component that is able to catch an attention.

Secondly, during the learning process, it is critically important to grow critical thinking in minds. Checking facts, doubts and questions are
 the
 tremendous component of teaching. Even modern artificial intelligence can not validate the information and prove the opinion without human beings. However, achievements due to technological progress may assist to 
teachers and increase their productivity. For example, I could imagine the 
future history lessons with videobooks instead of textbooks, but I hardly visualise the lesson without a teacher at all.

Overall, despite the fact that technology may play a big role in modern casual life, from my perspective, it is irrelevant in schools. The teachers are irreplaceable in this area, but technology could help raise the speed of getting information and the amount of data we are working with.

health. There are a number of reasons behind this point of view and several solutions should be proposes

There are two primary reasons why old ages are lonely and less healthy. One reason is that those people have not
 relatives and children, they live in 
a lonely life. Moreover, they don’t have friends to talk and
 take care them
 when they are sick, gradually
 they become weak and lack strength. For example, a seventy-olds
 person has a daughter who works far away from home, she can not come home the moment that her father has
 ill. Another reason is that the government does not build exercise facilities for people, especially older person
. While older folk need to 
healthy training, but 
their country has
 not exercise
 equipment.

However, measure
 must be taken by governments and international bodies to change this problem. Firstly, they need to improve some areas for exercise and health training, such as parks, squares
, …, building
 more exercise machines for area
 crowded with elderly people. Secondly, older people who have not
 children should go to a nursing home to have more friends and care of

reading early at a young age plays an essential role in children's life

 a faster reading speech compared with their peers because of the experiences which lead to he or she get

It goes without saying that learning to cook is a vital life skill and has many benefits for students, meaning learning how to cook not only promotes healthy eating habits, but also self-sufficiency, independence, and more.

Because the children chose

Firstly, achieving something individually helps getting
 a greater experience of success and fail

 effect to
 society.

While it is understandable that in the modern ages,technological equipment are
 increasing,people depend on it,from
 works
 to entertainment,cause robots and artificial intelligence work more effectively than humans 
works.For example,about calculating works,robots or artificial intelligence can work more correctly than humans and also about abilities and intelligence,it developed so fast and people have no chance to race it,that is why nowadays people depend on them and do not do it for themselves,it leads to their abilities slowly down and the flexible are
 decreased sharply.

Conversely,depend
 too much on technology can lead to losing our abilities and always being laziness,it will correct that robots and artificial intelligence can work fast and correctly as humans do but there many
 works that robots or technology equipment can not do and people need to stand up and get back to their work.For instance,in the UK,many scientists explore that in few
 years robots and artificial intelligence could replace humans workplace.

In conclusion, increasing robots and artificial intelligence are some of the biggest breakthroughs humans
 in modern ages,beside that it could be a double-blade in human society.

First of all, traditional assignments do not reflect the 
real-world scenarios or individual skills. In the vast majority of cases the tests taken by teachers at high educational places are made by a sample, and respectively do not require thinking out of the box. For instance, the English assessment usually consists of multiple choice
 questions, which restrict the way of thinking. This constraint would limit  the fully

 of medical workers and place

 more.Therefore,workers cannot serve effectivel

Without a shadow of a doubt, purchasing products online is able to bring a negative effect on the environment. The explanation for this could be that online platforms offer for 
customers a wealth of discounts together with promotions on fashion so buyers consume more fast fashion than sustainable one because it is  cheaper, which leads to the amount of waste from this industry increases. For instance, the Tiktok platform always has discounts from 20 to 50 percent
 when customers make purchases, which attracts thousands of buyers. Thus, although online shopping is convenient and less time-consuming, it still has disadvantages.

While the impact of online shopping on the environment is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of job
 is ignored.  This might be because buying items online results in some social issues. For example, online shopping becoming customary will cause some companies to go bankrupt, which will lead to thousands of people being unemployed. Hence, online shopping can bring

 obsolete suggest that the rapid advancement of technology could lead to automation replacing numerous jobs. They argue that AI's ability to perform tasks efficiently and accurately poses a threat to traditional human roles. However
 i
 do not agree with this view. AI cannot replicate human qualities like creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced decision-making remain essential in certain professions. For instance, professions such as counseling
, artistry, and leadership heavily rely on human attributes that AI cannot effectively emulate.

On the other hand, those who believe in the enduring importance of human work point out that AI lacks certain qualities essential for many roles. And i

Although, it is every citizen's responsibility to follow rules and regulations to run their surroundings smoothly. People claiming
 that the benefits it offers are no match for its drawbacks. 

I agree to
 the given notion as government
 has to impose stringent orders to make this world a better place.

Firstly, human rights are essential up to some extent as if pupils are not free, they will not be able to grow as in some countries humans do not have freedom
 to speech as we can take an example of Gaza where everything is ruined and public
 is surviving alot
 due to terrorist attacks. So, freedom is also necessary.

Secondly, some countries has
 very strict laws and this actually shaped people into good human beings. For instance, in Dubai
 if you are leaving
 your car windows open, nobody will steal your goods even if it costs millions of dollars as they cut hands
 of theives
. So, I agree that it is important for the administration to force masses
 to follow legal codes.

To sum up, I agree that it is important for every country to land with some sort of harsh acts so that masses
 do not take benefit to hurt others.

First and foremost,as
 a candidate,they
 often coming
 from different University

,and often learn a  string of professional skills as well as knowledge in various departments.It is hard to definite whether one of them is excellent.The best way is to ask or investigate their life or work experience,thus,can tell if they are suited for the company or even bring huge financial potential to the team.Secondly,as an employer, it is undeniable that they can pick up anyone they want or just based on  academic qualifications. However, you can never know the ability of participants,which could take
 a huge disaster for your organization.For example, a student or a postgraduate has a hard communicate 

skills and can even not cooperate with his colleagues,which would cause stagnant in whole the working procedure.Therefore, life experience is very important for a 
staff.

On the other hand , personal qualities are have
 ultimate importance, also. it is obvious that  bad personal qualities may have a potential impact on the company. For instance,a staff's dishonour would influent not only themselves, but also  the whole team or even the whole company's fame.In this regard, we should make good use of the chance of recruiting meet
 and the 
interview
 to get in touch with each other to realise its value.

 problem is the

To begin with, why this is responsibility
 of politicians because they are easily controlling these types of activities in their own country. They can easily discuss with other countries on the global level to control and make the 
new strategies. For example, In the last decades, the administrations are
 more focused on an 
electric vehicle
 rather than petrol or diesel Vehicle and provided some subsides
 on that,
 so that people can easily buy.

On the other sides
, the governments passed some rules related to the 
environment
 issues and asked to people follow these rules strictly. If they not
 follow this rule then set the
 high penalty cost.  The governments only make the rules but follow by people. For instance, the 
Indore City has won the first prize in India for first
 cleanness
 city from
 the last four years. Such as, if we understand their
 own responsibilities than
 de-solve
 any issues without any damages

 dangerous jobs and also help them to

It is recognizable that a lot of jobs that 
require strength and endurance like working in
 construction sites and other similar jobs. Those

 the rate by adding robots to deal with the hard and dangerous work. For example, the mobile robots that can be added to construction
 size will have more effective progress and invulnerable

It is undeniable that the most of pollution came
 from exhaust
 from the 
vehicles on the road as a result of effect
 to
 climate change and ecosystem
. For example, when people use the
 vehicles in the morning at the same time caused 
it have
 high
 quantity of bad pollution and dust from emission

 orgin
 to the 
global warming.

Moreover, increasing of 
price
 will be helped to reduce a
 number of car
 and many people will choose public transportation such as bus
, subway
, taxi
, and 
etc. or biked
 a bicycle instead of private
 car for

. After that, when a human selected
 the way it can fixed
 the issue which reduce
 overcrowded on the street. Furthermore, it will reduced
 the quantity of dust and decreasing
 in pollution when the number of car
 was
 dissappeared
 from the road and especially, the government should be managed
 and provided

convenience
 and sufficient for population
 in the city.

In conclusion, it is the best way to solve the problem because while the cost of fuel was

On the one hand, it can not be denied that many young employees quit work
 with one another for different reasons. Some people find themselves exploited by their seniors in their factories. To explain, some certain capitalist companies require their workers to work a lot but employees are not being paid adequately, so their health is not being ensured leading to work inefficiently.

In addition, it might be because the new young generations can not withstand great pressure like older generations because they live in an environment is
 more ease than the past ones.

However, this causes much damage, for example, if employees still work for a few months then
 quit that work, it might decrease the quality of the product in each company leading to direct
 effect on the income of that company and many organizations or investors as well. On the contrary, the starting of all tasks is difficult, they have to accept and gradually overcome, the
 can not decide by themselves because the company is organised, they ought to work with many other people.

 hard to follow the job, they have to try every day instead of quitting the job quickly.

 become an integral part of our everyday life. From billboards to pop-up advertisements on devices, we are constantly surrounded by marketing messages. I tend to think that such a tendency has both positive and negative sides. Nevertheless, I believe that if advertising are
 used for the right purposes, their
 benefits outweigh their
 drawbacks. I advocate strongly with my own view and I am going to provide some arguments, which will confirm my position. 

On the one hand, advertising plays a crucial role in informing consumers about products and services. By demonstrating the advantages and features of a product, it helps customers make a
 right decision about their purchases. For instance, when a new snood released
, advertising helps potential buyers understand its capabilities and decide if it meets their needs. In this sense, advertising can be seen as a valuable tool for both business
 and consumers. 

On the other hand, advertising has the ability to manipulate and deceive people. Companies often use clever marketing tactics to create a sense of urgency or desire to purchase their products, encouraging consumers to make impulsive purchases that they may later regret. 

Taking everything into account, although advertising serves a vital purpose informing
 consumers and promoting products, increasing prevalence in everyday life has both positive and negative implications.

 children's development and some people believe it is beneficial for them. I discuss both views in the upcoming paragraphs and agree with former
 view.

Firstly, people who argue that television is beneficial for children are considering that international programs encourage kids to work hard and grow worldwide because celebrities are casted
 by some channels who
 influence young
 generation to show their talents through media and become successful in life. To cite an example, in  India
 there are many shows which are seen by kids and they  work hard to reach on 
those stages and participate in them, consequently, they get selected and become popular Worldwide.

Secondly, spending excessive amounts of time by 
watching television is 
not only stops children's cognitive growth but also waste
 their time in which they should be playing outdoor activities as well as doing 
socializing. For example, International
 survey has been conducted that 80% of children invest their time watching television instead of going outside to play with others, therefore, they face some health obstacles such as obesity as they do not do physical activity. As a result, they become introvert
. Also,television does not encourage deep thinking and concentration.

cigarettes quit their habit. A law prohibiting smoking in public areas forces smokers to leave

the company of everyone else if they want to have a cigarette. Most people dislike feeling

brought about by smoking bans is often cited by ex-smokers as one of the reasons they gave

up the habit.

#punishment","There is no such a 
thing that  
a country does
 not have a prison. Prisons have been used as a place for criminals since hundreds of years ago . I tend to disagree with this opinion . In this essay
 I will support my view with examples.

 A growing number of people believe that  criminals should be sent to jails regardless of the  seriousness of the crimes they commit  as punishment . Sentencing jail term
 to criminals shows justice not only for the victims but also for the community . There is common
 belief that criminals do not belong to community
 for safe
 and security reason
. This is the reason that people still believe that prison is the best punishment for criminals.

From my point of view , prison is not the best place for punishment . In this modern world ,there are some alternatives to detain the felons . For instance , children under age
 of 18 should not be sent to main
 jail  together with others where  a great number of criminals stays
 and he or she can learn those bad habits and attitude
 from them . This will affect the physical and emotional development of children seriously . Shortly after he is released from the 
prison , he will not be able to behave like a decent one due to the experiences and influence of inmates from the prison . 

Therefore , the prison is not the best place for  those young children also known as minors . They should be put in a training school where he
 can learn and study . He should be taught how to behave and survive in this tough world  after fulfilling the sentence. For petty criminals , they should be sentenced to do some community work such as volunteering in the
 nursing home or  

cleaning and picking the
 rubbish for a certain amount of time . On the other hand , they can be restricted to go
 anywhere  by applying the electronic device at their ankles. There are the 
alternatives
 ways for criminals instead of the 
prison punishment .

In conclusion , Government
 should provide a places
 with a varieties
 of facilities for offenders depending on the 
gender and the 
age  . To make the
 better and safer community  , criminals should be disciplined and taught how to well behave and make a contribution to the community  instead of staying up in cells doe

It is true that nowadays, technological innovations have already become an essential part of people's lives, especially television and mobile phones. Undeniably, due to addiction and the magical relaxing effects that scrolling one's phones
 and watching television can arouse, there is quite a high chance for individuals to reduce their time for physical activities, just for the possibilities

 generation tends to enjoy thriller and suspense genres more often and therefore spends an ample amount of time watching them and my personal preference is also in it.

First of all, due to the advancement of 
Internet
 where every television show is in just 
the 
reach of touch, not only a variety of shows broadcast daily but also books and teleshows from the past and native language are converted to English
 language. for example, The money heist
 on 
aired language was Spanish but due to huge success, all seasons were later translated into English. A similar case was with the Korean drama Squid Game, which not only generated enormous revenue but also hit the box office worldwide. Furthermore, after the invention of popular shows and movie streaming applications like Netflix and Amazon Prime, these Adventuroeus
 series became hit
 worldwide.

Secondly, these fiction and violation papers and shows release dopamine and epinephrine, thus creating a sense of happiness and flight and fight response at the same time. For example
 the audience experiences such drift which is similar to consuming weed or marijuana, so due to its aura the viewers constantly search and scroll through stories similar in nature.

On the contrary, these unlawful videos and papers taught new ways of crime to the masses and 
the rate of which continues to increase in recent times. For example, in one of the stories, the robber killed the victim with a knife made of ice, thus leaving no clue of it. Further, It also pollutes young minds and teaches them new ways to harm the norms.

to conclude, In my opinion, a balance is required while reading and watching the media which contain such a sensitive subject and a child who is not more than eighteen years of age should watch it as excessive usage of anything is not only harmful to himself but also to the 
society.

 a result
 they spend many
 time of 
a 
day on it
. I suppose that’s not a positive development. 

As
 the development of technology smartphones have become a part of our daily life, due to its
 convenience. Most of 
student
 and children need smartphones to help with there
 education, for instance in many developed countries students hand in assignment
 with their mobile phone
, which is more efficient and convenient. In this case
 they
 tutors can know more about their students. What’s more due to the covid 19 there is a new kind of teaching way which is the 
online class, with the 
smartphones students have chance
 to learn knowledge wherever and whenever they want. Additionally smartphone is also a contact device. Instead of telephones or letters, mobile phone
 are more convenient with more functions, such as sending message
, having video calls…… As a result
 most of the families would prepare phones for their kids. In this way
 they believe their
 could be safer, because of the connection. 

In my viewpoint
 this is a negative development. At a 
first point, I believe that smartphones can easily influence children negatively because they are not mature enough. To begin with, kids may be induced by the games accessed by phones due to lack
 of self-control. For instance
 almost 60% of children use phone
 to play games instead of using it
 as an 
educational tools. This apparently wastes their time. Additionally
 children lack adequate judgement, result
 in a lack of clarify
 whether
 the information is good or bad since they may be easy to be misguide
 by some message
 on the internet. A young boy , for instance
 could be tempted by the advertisement on the smartphone and then gamble online. This absolutely leads him to a criminal way.

In conclusion
 smartphones are hitting every conner
 of the world due to its
 convenient

 children spend
 too much time on mobile phones is not a positive development.

, we have to solve this problem together. In this essay, I will attempt to identify causes and propose some effects that this matter bring
 about.

Broadly speaking, there are some main problems with this issue. Firstly, the major cause of this issue is that most children prefer high-calories
 food such as hamburgers, pizzas, and something like fozen
 foods. These foods have spicy and salty tastes and it is easier to cook so that makes children eat instant foods frequently. Secondly, another reason is that most children have bad habits such as they lie after eat

 and having irregular eating time.

In terms of proposing diverse effects to this apparent dilemma, the members of socetiy
, government, and researchers should cooperate together to reduce this problem. First of all, when badly
 habits sustained
, some childrens
 will have indigestion and some other health problems such as diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Secondly, obesty
 can makes
 depression because, if some people dissatisfied

 more serious. However

     However, some people believe those days deserve to be the best era for living. In my opinion, I refuse this notion for many reasons. First, although these days have rapid advancements of
 technology and many facilities which Make the 
life easier than before,they are used wrongly. As a result, people spend most time surfing the internet and browsing social media applications. Also
 the children became slaves to the smartphone or electronic devices. In addition, most teenagers are obsessed with YouTubers  and tick Tooker's
 more than studying. Secondly, there are natural disasters and wars in different places  in the present era . As a result, there are famines, epidemics and economic recession all over the world.

 And they were exchanging visits and congratulations, particularly in ceremonies, Eids, and Ramadan. For instance, when the Eids were coming , my siblings and I were gathering in my family's house on the first day of the Eid, to celebrate together. But now people are exchanging the

 stickers and images through WhatsApp and Facebook. In addition, our children were listening to their grandparents' stories, and they were meeting each other every weekend. Furthermore, we were feeling emotional and mental stability because we were owners and known in our country but these days we became
 foreigners who rent homes to live in.

Discussing the dark side of the viewpoint, the first and prominent argument is that, because people's life span is now increased the cycle of birth and death is now distrubed
. For instance, there are
 fewer death
 in the 
recent years which has lead
 to increase
 in population. Further, population
 rate is skyrocketing in several countries. To give or example, according to a survey on population taker place in India, it is the fifth country in terms. of population in 2015, but in 2023 India becomes the secand
 largest populated nation.

 in folks is directly
. proportional to increase in unemployment as well as increase
 in usage of resources like petrol, diseal

 in job opportunities, as there are numerous individuals applying for the some
 job. For example, if there is a job for employee
 in a
 advertising company, atleast
 they will get more than 2000 applicants. Moreover, as people are living longer than expected, numerous folks have their own vehicles and due to increasement

 engineering and software programming occupations are more popular and common in job markets. Therefore, it is frequently argued that students at primary school ought to study software programming, while other people believe that children must spend their times
 at secondary school for 
playing rather than focusing on hard academic topics. In my opinion, playing at primary school is more beneficial for children than studying subjects. This is due to the fact that difficulties
 topics make children asocial persons.

First and foremost, people why think that prioritize
 software lessons at primary school is that children are able to improve their problem- solving
 skills in their childhood. In fact, when individuals advance their abilities in their child
 times, they would
 be an 
expert
 in these fields such as digital literacy. For example, a survey shows that,
 most employees in computer science engineering are excellent in mathematics and creativity and innovation skills. This is in light of the fact that they developed their those abilities,
 when they were kids. As a result, they could succeed on
 working professionally in computer
 engineering sector.

On the other hand, the main reason for believing children at primary school should play games and do physical activities is that children need to improve their social abilities namely communication others
 and confidence. In other words, prominent beneficial skills for kids are advancing their personality talents. They prepare them to live better
 lifestyle in the future. As a matter of fact, focusing on hard subjects at
 childhood make
 them confusing
 and overwhelming
 from social lifestyles. For instance, 75% of workers in iPhone company is
 a well-known organization
 in digital
 sector are asocial and lonely. It is said that they spent their childhood to learn
 hard academic topics rather than contact
 each other. Consequently, they could not touch on others correctly in their workplaces.

Personally, I feel that children need to play at primary school. This is owing to the fact that,
 individual’s
 childhood times is
 more appropriate to

live make 
entertainment time. Hence, they can create a good career in the future.

In conclusion, software programming should educate

. Beyond doubt, there have been many discussions revolving around the issue of whether the development of tourism should be beneficial for the economy by some people or others think this development is very harmful for
 local people. In the next paragraphs, I will delve into the advantages and disadvantages of tourism development in their detail.

To begin with, one of the main advantages of tourism is that the economic thriving can be provide
 with this. The development of tourism leads to open many workplaces such as tourism offices, hotels, destinations
, which ensuring
 the 
thousands of vacations. All of them can be the level of well-being. Namely, economic development will affect in turn the improving education and medical sectors. What`s more, tourism is the most significant factor for

 their obtain
 the 
political power. Therefore, the more people, the better for them.

In
 the other hand, there are some drawbacks in
 the development of tourism. It is clear that,
 many forests and places destroy
 for the building of hotel
 and tourism
 destinations. Consequently, all these result in many problems such as the 
climate change. For this reason, many climate changers criticized this issue in the UN for years. Furthermore, the 
one of another reason
 of
 this drawback is that
 difficulties local residents face. That is, the high 
prices
 policies are implemented in touristic

economic development which is not suit for local people. For this reason, they complaint

To sum up, the benefits of tourism development are more related to the 
economic development which provide
 well-being, and opportunities for countries to spread their culture. In contrast, the drawbacks of tourism development involve some problems such as destroying natural places and the high costs for local people.

On one
 hand, learning a language is essential because almost all social sectors require this skill. In today’s modern society, more and more children have realized that learning languages is key to their successful careers. Consequently, the number of training courses focusing on teaching languages is increasing. For example, in Mongolia, recent data shows that over one thousand companies are engaged in linguistic businesses.

On the other hand, gaining knowledge in science is fundamental to education because it can develop children’s cognitive skills, which are extremely useful in daily life. Without science
 knowledge, it is difficult to imagine creating a well-developed society as it nurtures analytical and critical thinkers. Not only do skillful engineers emerge from this knowledge, but also social advocates. For example, the famous scientist Darwin was a social influencer for human rights while exploring natural science.

In conclusion, while learning languages can secure children’s future career pathways, exploring science-based subjects is equally important as it also benefits their brain development.

 problems can be alleviated by enlightening the elderly and securing vocations only for them. 

To begin with, older people competing with younger people for the same position is highly unfair to the elderly as younger people possess much more enriched information and knowledge related to the occupation. For instance, they know how to answer to 
the job interview and how to write a successful resume as they are easy to access information through job communities such as Linked-in

. Thus, they excel at employment, making seniors harder to be employed. Moreover, this trend also culminates in overly

Moving professionals from their own country to another developing country can have bad
 effect on the economy of their poorer countries. By ""professionals"" I mean doctors and teachers. If their

 the

 people, and medicine will not be developed. And the end, the
 will be one step closer to a deteriorating economy. For example, according to the scientists in

On the one hand,shopping centers
 attract a lot of residents and promote trade and job creation , but the main part of the profits is concentrated in
 a few big complaints. Consumer like to spend their free time and their money in shopping malls, because it gives a sensation of affluence and security. Besides that, everybody ends up consuming sometimes, poor people are kept away from these places. Moreover, more shopping areas than greens
 spaces promote sedentary

. 

On the other hand, public parks and sport
 facilities normally are free of change and are an opportunity to keep in contact with natural
 and live a healthier life. In the medium and long term , this kind of facility in
 more significant to towns, and it help
 to promote health and leisure for all social classes. 

       In conclusion,  I believe that are
 more important to design public areas for parks and places to do sports than building shop areas. The  business  will find local
 to do their business anyway. Besides that, the public power has the responsibility to encourage outdoor activity and a better lifestyle through free public venues like sports facilities and parks

Firstly, discussing the reasons behind modern
 situation of both parents working, the first Land
 foremost argument is that, the whole world o wolving at a greater pace. Due to this, everything out there from a reedle
 to a brulding
 are
 becoming costly day by day. Hence, by the salary or wages from only one worker in a family. is very difficult to run a house. Furthermore, parents are also worried of

. Because, if they wants
 to send theus
 children to some better school or university, ther
 will denfinitely
 need more amount of money Lastly, educated individuals probabaly
 thinks
. that if they don't do any kind of work, then their education qualification or degree is of no use. Therefore, due to this reason both parents in families are working..
However, due to this situation
 children will have negative
 effect on them. To begin with, if they are not supervised by their any 
parents there is a good chance that they will be influenced by the
 bad friends. The good children con
 even turn to delinquent in the future Following these, they may develop addication
 of
 smoking, drinking and drugs. As a result, these all can have harmful effect
 on them.

To sum up, I am not against of 
both parents working. However, I strictly believe that a father and a mother of a 
children must spend quality time with their young ones and also supervise them. This will greatly reduce the risk of the children 
attached
 by bad people or will not develop any addicition
 which may be harmful to them.

 for their members to improve the
 membership. For example, many famous malls do not need to use any sale or advertisement to sell their products, because it will make their products prices fall down. Therefore, sale

 think that professionals are able to choose workplaces freely.

If experts work in the country where they were trained, they are more likely to be familiar with mechanics and systems in some specific areas which can help them do further surveys and experiments using the same methods and instructions learned before to contribute to both the economic and technologic development. For example, doctors learned
 specific treatments at college are able to conduct in 
operations in local hospitals in the country they
 did their training.

Meanwhile, however, experts have 
rights
 to choose their
 workplaces they like. Because overseas students may prefer returning to their home conutries
 to make achievements and do
 contributions. As well as other professionals may sometimes wish to work in another country rather than do some careers where they studyed
 due to limited environment of potential development.

 growth in the country they live and work. It is obviously significant to protect the resources of domestic talented people due to their intelligence. While people should also need to be awared
 of the freedom of experts as not only their decisions to choose their locations are important, but the knowledge and discoveries they have already had and found are also useful.

 in the newspaper and broadcast
 in
 the 
television it
 decided by the news editors. The factors influence
 that kind of decisions
 are differences between news,
 and the topic of news. I think we are not used to bad news because its
 news
 repoters
 duty what
 the things going they had
 captured.  Besides, it will definitely better
 if more good news were reported. 

Firstly, the differences between news and the topic mostly influenced the editor
 what they broadcast in media and what printed
 in newspaper
.  For example, if a incident are on going
 such as a terrific acident
, suddenly earthquake happen
 they immediately broadcast it on media as people aware about
 this incidents
.On the other hand
 political decision
 and market rate
 or some educational news they 
may printed on 
news which is important but not too much.  They decided on this basis that what news are
 important that deliver
 among people immediately and what news deliver
 after 5 to 6 hours later on
 newspaper
. 

In addition, I think no, we are not used to bad news. It is repoters
 duty what
 they present in their news if we do bad then they used
 us to promote their news and if we do good things they shows
 us for our appriciate
.  They just shows
 the things whats
 happen around the world. Such as,
 many celebraties
 lifestyle
 used
 as a hot topic by
 their different living,  behaiviour
. Furthermore, it was of course better if good news were reported more. News and media channel plays an essential role in our everyday life. A
 good news is as
 bless
 as 
for us. For example, a good 
news make
 a mans
 day better when he read
 it before go
 out for work. News always contains the things and themes whats on going around the world, so if the news is good then we realize that everything is fine in our society. 

In conclusion, it is so much 
clear that editor
 decided
 what they printed
 or telecasted
 on the basis of topics, besides 
we never used to makes
 a 
news while the incident only shows in the news. And finally
 it was
 good without 
doubts
 if more 
better news were delivered by the editors.

 products. I completely agree with this idea and there are two principal reasons for this. 

One point which I believe to be absolutely pivotal is the fact that after some time all the natural resources will be gone and it will have a huge negative impact not only on the 
nature or
 the lifestyle of people,
 but also on the world economy because a lot of companies will suffer from this and more people will be unemployed. Several examples can be which serve
 to illustrate this point. There have been published a lot of articles on this topic, too. As an example, deforestation in South America has become a huge issue and a lot of people are concerned about it. Because without forests more animals will be distinct and of course, the absence of trees would affect people, too. 

Adding further credibility to the statement brings to an idea of fluctuations in economy
 of the world. Admittedly, it will lead a lot of companies to bankruptcy and more people will suffer from unemployment. 

To sum up, by taking into account all the above mentioned
 reasons, I once again reaffirm my position that it is important for the government to encourage people to use long lasting
 products because in this case, the natural resources would be renewed.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of everyone in the world speaking the same language?","#languages
#people
#nationalities
#language
#world","There is a widely held perception that communication among various nationalities becomes way more difficult because they speak different languages. And it would be way better to have only one common language, so people will not have any difficulties while talking to people from other nationalities. However, there are both pros and cons when we apply it to the real world. 

Let's begin by looking at the advanatges
 of speaking only one language all over the world. One of the main positives would probably be the fact that no one would struggle with language
 barrier. What I mean by this is that nowadays, even if people learn one language for many years they cannot speak it like native speakers. This causes a huge problem for language learners, however
 if everyone would speak
 the same language from their childhood, this problem would disappear. 

Turning to the other side of the argument every nation's culture is hidden in their language. And 
this leads to the fact that cultures will lose their unique part, possibly along with their traditions and customs. Moreover, learning new languages helps people to improve their brain activity and makes their outlook wider, which is one of the main positive sides of learning new langauges
. 

To put it in a nutshell, all the reasons that were mentioned before lead us to a
 conclusion that speaking one langauge
 throughout the world may have some positive sides, but along with that cultures will lose their unique traditions customs and so on. Moreover, in this case, the majority of people will stop learning new languages and this will lead to the fact that people will stop learning other cultures and the history of those cultures which would affect their outlook in a negative way. Personally, I believe that having various languages around the world is important and countries should not change their nation's languages to one common.

 I will discuss both views and I will write what are the disadvantages and advantages for

On one
 hand, having only one job could have advatages
 and also disadvantages. For example, some advantages could be that working in the same place for long
 time, can bring you a lot of bonuses and promotions, and also you will get better and better on
 your position. Secondly, having the same job, and working only for one company forever could make you tired and keep you in the cofort

On the other hand, some persons will preffer

 advatage
 when is
 about to learn more than one thing and develop your skills, changing job
 all the time can also bring  you a lot of connections with different people and your cv will be also a large one. When is
 about
 disadvantages, if the job is changed frequently, the chance to get promoted will be reduced and the chance to get really good at something,
 will also be reduced because you will not have time to see if you are good or not, if you can improve or not, because you always change the job. 

To conclude, having only one job, or changing the 
job
 frequently, have
 advantages and disadvantages and the best choise
 is to find the balance between these two, change your job until you are happy where you are and feel ready to try more than one job, but in the end, I believe that having only one job will be better instead of change the job all the time.

 devices, which can be accessed anywhere. Albeit, smart devices are 
unfortunately accounted
 for the disturbance of privacy and being such convenient devices, they can often lead to addiction. 

Information about individuals on the internet spread
 in a matter of minutes; being such a large network, it is almost impossible to control. For example, Taylor Swift wears disguises to alter her appearance in the hopes of not being identified, otherwise
 her location will be available for
 the entire world in a few minutes. Moreover, these devices can also distribute personal images and videos of not only celebrities,
 but everyday people. Thus, the internet undoubtedly disrupts the privacy of people.  

The internet is a gateway to obtain information on almost everything, which results in the majority of individuals constantly being on mobile devices.  For instance, a study at Harvard University found that individuals can get the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict when taking their electronical
 devices away.  Furthermore, with the internet came the invention of social media platforms that allows
 people to post information daily, this is undeniably a cause for excessive screentime

In conclusion, the internet is responsible for the lack of privacy and addiction among individuals. It is of

 far outweigh the advantages. Thus, chaos will break out if the internet continuous

 what is likely better for their kids- attempting to nursery or being at home with caring family members, such as grandparents. To be honest, I believe that nurseries or other pre-
school courses are the best thing in baby
 care institute. This essay will discuss both of 
beliefs and explain the reasons of
 supporting my point of view. 

On the one hand, some people think that grandparents will be better careers for their children due to several reasons, such as their unrequited love. The supporters of this point of view truly believe that there is no safe place for their preschool age
 kids except home while there are
 a lot of terrible news about cruel teachers of nursery
 in different regions of our country. For example, I”ve
 read about death
 of 3 years
 child during his walk with teacher
 in the nursery in Almaty city 2 years ago. Also, there
 is no secret that kids, which
 attend nurseries are the 
regular patients of  hospitals with different kinds of diseases. For this reason, many people prefer staying at home with their grandparents untill
 they will attemp
 a 
school. 

   

  On the other hand, the opponents of this, including me, think that grandparents have a right to live their own life, travelling or doing what they want while their grandchildren can enjoy their pre-school time with their peers. For example, my children have attempted the nursery at the age of 3, and there are a lot of advantages which I’ve seen. They became more independent and social
 active rather than their peers, which
 parents decided their kids to stay at home untill
 school age. Also
 they’ve never had a 
trouble with their studies at
 the first year of school, because they were totally ready to
 this due to the variety of lessons in nursery
. 

 

   In conclusion, despite some people think that grandparents will take care of their kids better than nurseries, it has been increasingly noticed that,
 children must socialize and attempt the educational places long before their first day at school.

 culture to
 person
. Personally, I believe that the culture of our country of origin has less effect on us, rather than other things. This essay will discuss both sides of this view, and will widely explain the reasons to support my opinion based on real life
 examples.

On the one hand, some people believe that the birth nation has an important role in setting an individual’s culture, due to several reasons. The supporters of this point of view are sure that one’s behaviour starts to develop in the womb. Finally
 they say: people learn the culture even before they were born. Although,
 people travel everywhere and even live in
 the other side of world
, they will always be connected to their motherland, since they developed an emotional attachment with
 their birth place’s culture. For example, Irina Sheyk
, a very popular fashion model from Russia, even though, she spent most of her life in United
 States of America, she 
never lost her love towards Russian traditional cuisine or wear. For this reason, many people think that an individual’s birthplace plays a dramatic role in defining the culture.

On the other hand, the opponents of this, including me, think that native location has a minor influence on behaviour development. Many researches have proved that humans are capable of adapting to any conditions and traditions. There is even a proverb such as “ Don”t
 go to someone”s monastery with your rules”. Many people prefer to stick to foreign traditions, where they live and forget about their owns
. For example, I’ve met many kazakh
 families, which live
 several
 years in United
 Kingdom, and they are fond of english
 life culture, their practicality and callousness, which totally contradict with 
kazakh’s
 lifestyle. Due to this trend in society, I strongly believe that native locations have less influence in defining the character of the person.

In conclusion, although some people think that the culture of an individual depends on their birthplaces
, it has been increasingly noticed that,
 humans are adapting to various cultures due to their location for 
today or their
 influence of globalization.

 seriously, also it would be stressful for people think
 about important issues after their working day,
 when only
 one 
thing they want-just
 relax.

     Social issues such as environmental causes of overpollution or juvenile crimes should be discussed during TV news or serious interviews with the specialists of this sphere,
 because people can’t take it seriously while they are watching stand-up shows or comedy battles. For example, me
 and my husband are fond of the stand-up show with Azamat Musagaliev, where he always mentiones
 so terrible problems of all countries like corruption or poor condition of our villages, but we’ve never thought seriously about these issues while we are just laughting

 with
 traffic jams in the city centers
 should be solved by developing fast

 of continuous noise and air pollution, in addition, it is a serious problem for the lifestyle of pedestrians and cyclists of that area.

      At first, building of  
this type of roads systems
 are
 more often provided by cutting down the forests and destroying environmentally significant landscapes. Such areas produce a major amount of oxygen and are crucial for the health of local residents. Furthermore, the ability to travel faster by private car discourages people from using the 
public transport, which causes far less air pollution by transporting more people by one bus or tram.

     In addition, existence
 of ring roads has a negative impact to
 pedestrians and cyclists. For example, when we had travelling
 to Dubai city with my immediate family last year, instead of walking down the streets, we had to get a taxi even for a tiny distance because of ring
 road system, which we were not able to cross. Such road systems made local people, who prefer walking or cycling, to 
choose between make
 a long detour to cross the road or travel
 by car.

   In conclusion, despite constructing
 the
 fast ring roads could be helpful for avoiding traffic congestion, it has been increasingly noticed, that it would have a significantly negative impact to
 pollution and people’s life

 and alter
 the way we receive the 
news from all over the world. Some argue that listening news
 without visual pictures is the convenient way but others are denying
 and prioritize to 
television news. This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion.

On the one hand, radio allows individuals to obtain news updates without disrupting their daily tasks, making it convenient for multitasking. For example, it has been proven by United
 States in 2023, 60
% of people prefer listening radio
 news as they not only complete their daily tasks during
 getting knowledge of all around the world but also maintain their health improvement by neglecting screen news. It is thus proved by above

 that radio has made its space sustainable during this modern period due to its abundance benefits
.

On the other hand, most of the masses opine that watching television news benefits to 
those who get confused without visual elements which assist them to comprehend
 better to get 
knowledge about stories. If a person, for example, lost
 his baby due to some reasons then he can easily provide baby's
 picture to those channels who
 broadcast news on television and everyone around the world can visualize that picture on screen who
 sometimes can help people to find lost
 baby. It is clear from this given reason that television not only provides us information
 but also shows us some visual activities.

After analyzing the above points, it is felt that radio is the best option to get knowledge without effecting
 our health and delaying daily tasks. It is hoped that coming
 generation would
 help to sustain its place as it is nowadays.

 due to its negative and positive effects on society. While some contend that it has more negative effects on youth, debaters argue that it has some positive aspects such as connecting people from all over the world. This essay will discuss both the 
viewpoints and will present my reasons to support the later
 view.

To begin with the former opinion, a group of individuals believes that social platforms like Facebook and Instagram leads
 to adverse effect
 such as,
 deficient communication skills and vulnerable
 to choose wrong
 path. In other words, nowadays, children learn to chat with their friend
 by typing with the help of their hands; however, when they meet anyone in person it becomes very difficult for them to communicate. For example, I belong to a joint family. When I was a child, we
 were eight children in our family and we all were very talkative with our families and relatives, in contrast, now we have six children in are
 family, but they all are introverts they all keeps
 chatting on 
their phone
 but never comes out of their room and talk with their family. Nevertheless, when youngsters are unsupervised there is high
 risk of falling for any e-scam. 

On the other hand, others and I believe that social networking has some perks such as,
 connecting globally and it keeps
 you posted regarding current affairs. To explain, a person sitting in Japan can talk to a person living in Canada. Additionally, maintaining relationships with your friends and relatives has been way easier now. For instance, my mother lost touch with her friends, because her generation was not priviladge
 with
 the facility of internet and social media, but I am still in contact with my school friend on Facebook. Also, in previous decades the 
news channels and newspaper
 were the only option
 to stay updated with global news, however, now Instagram and twitter
 keeps
 you posted with every single global crises
. Political scams are also reduced because of the fear of social media power. 

To conclude, I believe that, although sites like Facebook and Twitter has
 few
 drawbacks like lack of personal development and risk of choosing wrong
 path, the advantages it has such as connecting people from different countries and knowledge about current
 situation is
 beneficial for a 
younger generation.

 their pastime.  Although I believe that young individuals are influenced by their peers at work who follow the latest trend, I argue that they should look for other activities as a leisure time. 

It has been argued that young people go shopping as a hobby and may buy unnecessary things. Some analyzers
 believe that individuals are more likely affected by their colleagues at work or friends in their youth. They also proved advertisements encourage young citizens to buy different things. Therefore, young adults try to spend their time to buy
 somethings
 which are used by more people or they watch on 
TV advertising. For example, apple company
 conducted a survey and announced that most young people prefer to buy apple's
 products as luxury items. 

Some experts prove that young should encourage
 to do beneficial activities instead of shopping as a hobby. They believe that if youth go to gym
 or doing
 yoga instead of go
 shopping, they will be fit and also can save money. In my opinion, in addition to doing sports activities, young people can learn new skills in their leisure time by participating in online courses and enhanced
 their self-esteem . For instance, some big companies offer numerous free courses annually for their young employees not only to learn new skills, but their young members also can enjoy their free time during these workshops. 

In conclusion, according to some ideas, youth are being shopaholic
 because of wrong advertisements. I believe they should be encouraged to spend their time on 
learning new proficiency or doing some sports because these activities could help them to improve themselves.

 finance and image of a country. Firstly, the government creates more income. Elite athletes will want to come this
 country for the top training, as
 a result, it can bring a country more income. Secondly, establish a national profession

#children
#massage","It is often argued that anyone who tries will acquire anything that they want. Especially, in some cultures, parents and teachers have told to children that if they work hard and have concrete plans they will succeed certainly. Generally speaking, this message has some pros and cons that in this essay I will discuss and elucidate my opinion. 

Lets
 begin
 by looking at the advantage. One of the main positive points of encouraging youngsters to gain things that they want is that,
 they attempt hard which leads to some extent being successful
 and give
 motivation to hone themselves more and more. In fact, the more they are sermonized, the more they achieve.

Furthermore, this can push children not only to achieve anything that they want, but also for
 not being
 lazy and active which this 
makes it possible for children to spend time with those who are interested in succeeding, and this action can have a direct effect on their future. Take children who goes
 to gym
 and study with children who are 
stay at home and play video games, explicitly, the first group of children will gain more than the second.

Turning on the other side of the argument, this action can be kind
 of daydream due to existing
 some factors that can be effective, such as affluent parents and nice
 culture as well as favouritism on
 children
 future. What’s more, when they encounter reality, it can make youngsters depress
 and feel emptiness.

Another issue is that, if they don’t achieve anything that they wanted
, they will be irate from
 their culture and do some bad thing, For instance, they might suicide or leave their hometown and such staff. 

All in all, as can be seen from the points in this essay, you need to weigh up the positive and negative points. In spite of the fact that,
 it is efficient to cultures tell children to being
 bully
 and work hard for life and anything they want, in my opinion, should be to 
somewhat otherwise their expectations will rise which can be harmful.

 thought of witnessing a decline in a population of peole
 preferring conventional practice of writing has became
 increasingly common. This essay shed
 light upon possible reasons as well as its
 consequences.

To begin with, many reasons are assosicated
 with the fact of reduction of writing skills. The dominant reason is advancement
 of technological inventions. To be more specific, exposure to use
 electronic gadgets due to work or school curriculm
 is motivating to use online applications for typing rather then
 writing by hand. Therefore, due to presence
 of technical resources people prefer not to write. It has been observed that,
 electronic applications are convenient to use as comapred
 to old writing methods. To be precise, such online platforms have useful features like grammar and vocabulary auto- 
correction softwares
 which makes them less time -consuming
 with better outomes
. As a result, there are hardly any chances of misinterpretation and errors.

On the contrary, despite the merits, there are people those 
who think writing noy by hand is a negative developlment
.The contributing factore
 is,
 loss
 of a 
skill. To elaborate, writing is not jsut
 limited to taking notes, but its
 an artform
. There are many schools and colleges that organize writing competions
 such as calligraphy. Therefore, people will lose competence if an individual does
 not write by hand. Besides, writing by hand improves cognative
 ability. Put simply, practicing
 a concept by writing it for 
several times, retains in
 one's memory for longer. Thus, helping to recall the same after years.

To conclude, althought
, technical devices has
 made it easier to store information by allowing to use different
 applications yet 
the benefits of writing by hand are 
are also not ignorable. I reiterate not writing by hand is a negative development.

To begin with, the regulation about being offenders to be

 a punishment to chastise people who break the law. It is clear that the 
life behin

 serious consequences and promote

 the power of political

 their illegal activities. For instance, with serious crimes like murder, they will put into practice the dealth
 penalty for criminals.

#sports
#school","It is argued that some people think team sports activities are the grandous
 method to enable children working
 with other people in a group. However, I disagree with that sentiment because of the following reasons. 

To commence with, through team sports, nevertheless, children already design their own strategy to achieve collective purposes. It is because in
 sports, children deem
 to be selective when recruit
 other people to their teams. In other words, the
 are likely to choose someone who is either already close or reliable to them since the purpose is to win a game, which contradicts with 
the fundamental aims of working together with other people. Therefore, it deters them to procure
 essential traits that can be learned through cooperative work such as tolerance and respect, as they think the situation is already under control. It can be seen when boys are likely teaming up with talented students in football
 match,
 and left
 behind some of their peers that cannot support them to win the game. 

Furthermore, there is another activity besides team sports that is more effective to taught
 children on working
 as a team. Take, for example, a group project, where children are likely to be united with random people from different background
. Referring from
 Albert Bandura’s research, this method was found to be reliable and prominent among kindergarten students because they were not solely focus
 to accomplish
 collective purposes whilst they also learn
 to unify different personalities and values, which in turn broadens
 their perspectives. Furthermore, the research also revealed that after involved
 in the group projects, students were willing to befriend with 
anyone in the classroom, which eventually alleviate
 social discrepancies between each student and hinder
 them from detrimental behaviours such as bullying. 

In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that team sports is
 the best approach to introduce
 children in
 working together. It is because in
 team sports, children already find their own way to achieve collective
 purpose. Moreover, I also think another pursuit such as group
 project
 is more effective to taught
 them since children are 
not only learn to accomplish goals,
 but also potentially embark several

large urban cities brings plethora
 of benefits for citizens, leading to degradation in quality
 of life. This essay will examine the main justification of these problems and possible solutions for addressing them.

  There are two main causes that would lead to less quality of life in the metropolitan cities which are increasing air pollution and crime throughout the cities. To be clear, during recent years, growthing
 in the proportion of population
 and using personal
 mechanical vehicle
 for commute
 more than before, emitting a lot of carbon dioxide in
 the atmosphere, increasing air pollution and leading to several diseases for humans and animals. For example, during the recent decade, Tehran has been suffering from heavy traffic which leads to more air pollution and most of its inhabitants deal with lung disease. Furthermore, some studies illustrate that crime is more likely in the big cities. In other words, in the 
metropolitan cities, having control on
 all parts of the city can be challenging, thus theft happens even more.

  Some possible solutions for these problems are establishing more public transportation and 
using electrical
 vehicles and also nurturing more policemen. To be clear,  the government should improve access to the public transport sectors so people use them more than their own cars. Also using the electrical machines can be more useful due to the fact that they do not consume fossil fuels, so it can help to reduce air pollution. Additionally, fostering more police staff and recognizing more video recorders can improve cities' security from robbers'
 attacks. 

    To conclude, Although the quality of life in the 
large cities face
 risk
 of degradation by increasing air pollution and crime rate, there are some possible solutions for these problems. The government's strategies for building more transport stations and using  electrical
 vehicles can be an efficient solution against air pollution and also educating more policemen and considering video recorders, boosting the security of cities.

To begin with, There is no doubt that, nowadays, a 
social media obviously influence

 they tent

 or  just want to copy what they have seen from the internet. For instance, numerous couples in Thailand copy wedding parties concept
 from the 
celebrities, which is

. To sum up, some organizer spend a lot of money on their events just to be impress
 others, this could lead to financial issues. if they could not afford it.

On the other hand, it is worths
 pointing out that there are good points of having a party. This is based on the face
 that some family members are not getting along with each other and this special occation
 would let them to 
meet up as well as could help improve a family's relationship. For example, wedding
 celemony
 in Thailand usually invites all family member
 to join, so this is a great opportunity to catch up with the members. 

In my opinion, wasting momey
 on special events or not? it really depends on the purpose of the parties. If it is happened
 to meet up with their old friends or family members, it would be worth to spend

 of a person depends like love, kindness , 
frienship
, the major source of happiness for a 
kin is still funds in his bank account, and I will discuss this idea in the following paragraphs.

First of all, due to paper money the wheel of the world is moving, so Yes, In this materialistic world, If  you want to buy something, you need cash. It also brings a sense of propserity
 in an individual and creates a sense of respect in the 
society. For example, Industrialists and Wealthy people tends

 a major chunk of cash in charity, thus creates
 a positive impact on others.

Secondly, Wealthy Individual

 memorable moments which lasts
 forever. For example, My Uncle works tirelessly for his business and we all pity on 
him, but every year he booked
 a lavish vacation trip for his family, thus creating lots of unforgettable memories, which could not be possible otherwise.

On the contrary, it is believed by many that a minimalist approach is better as it turns out to be contended and creates a sense of hormony
. Also, emotions like empathy, sense
 of respect, friendliness and positive family values can only be preached in less
 money approach. For exmple
, in a recent survey, It is observed that the children of middle class

surged in recent times and prioritized over the conventional method of teaching to the
 large number of pupils. Contemporary technology in teaching is very convenient and timesaving
 for students as well as for teachers. The primary advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon are discussed in the following passages.

On the one hand, there are various benefits of using new technologies for teaching students. Firstly, through the conventional method, it is very difficult for teachers to explain the 
complex topics to students. But, after the advent of new audio-visual technology, it is very easy to explain the 
tough topics with the help of animations. Additionally, since most educational institutes have adopted online teaching, students can easily learn from anywhere in the world, which is very convenient and timesaving
. 

Despite these advantages, there are many drawbacks of new technologies which not only affect the learning curve of students, but it affects the overall health of pupils. First, it is nearly impossible for teachers to know if students are paying attention while teaching online and as a result, most students can’t score well in exams. Furthermore, new gadgets require pupils to constantly use digital screes
 which is very harmful for students of all ages. For example, as per a recent study, nearly 50% of children below age
 of ten, wear spectacles due to excessive use of digital screens.

In conclusion, new technological advancements in education surely increase students’ ability to grasp the 
complex subjects, and they are far more convenient and timesaving
 for teachers and students than traditional methods. However, they negatively affect the learning curve of pupils and their eye sights

#skills","There is an ongoing debate regarding the merits of group activities versus individual activities in terms of developing important life skills. In this context, there are proponents who argue that group activities hold more prominence due to their collaborative nature, and I partially concur with this viewpoint. Nevertheless, I presumably believe that personal pursuits can also provide valuable life skills, if not more so.

Admittedly, advocates of activities done in group
 often highlight their
 collaborative nature of this endeavour, suggesting that people can mandate teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. In other words, working in a team setting can provide individuals with opportunities to learn how to cooperate, delegate tasks, and resolve conflicts effectively. This is mainly because group activities often simulate real-life scenarios where individuals must learn how to navigate diverse perspectives and work towards their common goals.

However, it is essential to recognise that solo pursuits offer an equal amount of invaluable life lessons. Undertaking such tasks alone renders its participant the ability to foster his 
self-reliance, independence, and accountability. This is because, while working independently, individuals must rely on their own judgement, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance to overcome challenges when compared to the approach of group activities. Therefore, in my view, this self-reliance not only instills
 confidence and resilience,
 but could
 also empower individuals to tackle obstacles with determination and resourcefulness.

A further advantage, somewhat related to the one mentioned above, is that solo activities will provide their inherent traits in deep introspection and personal growth. When working alone, individuals do have more freedom and pace with their own time to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and discover their strengths as well as weaknesses without a large scale of external influences. This self-discovery is especially integral to developing a strong sense of identity and purpose, which lies the main foundation for personal fulfilment and success in life. In addition to that, individual pursuits often require a high degree of focus and concentration, so honing essential skills such as time management, organisation, and critical thinking is siginificantly
 crucial in the scenario that if one wants to be an independent learner. 

In summarising up
, although group activities undoubtedly offer valuable opportunities for collaboration and interpersonal development, I contend that solo endeavours can teach equally important life skills. Self-reliance, independence, personal growth, and critical thinking are just a few examples of the invaluable skills that individuals can acquire through individual pursuits. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that group activities are superior to imparting essential life skills.

 during late night was always debatable, has
 now become more controversial. With many people claiming that it is beneficial , others rejct

controversy over the potential impact of this trend in recent years. In my opinion, this strict action appears to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate both
 positive
 and negative effects of the curfew and thus will reach a logical conclusion.

There are myriad of reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one stems from the fact of safety concerns as the curfew is necessary for the safety and security of teenagers from potential dangers such as crimes or accidents during late hours. For example, a recent news
 became very popular in US
 where a teenager was driving without 
driver
 license and killed 2 in crash

parents to handle their kids at home without these strict laws.

 that the 
only women have

 for taking care of them. In my opinion, I partly agree with this suggestion and I will give some examples in the bellow
 of this essay.

 Firstly, gender inequality still exists in this modern society. In this kind of 
issues
 we can see in the hiring to job
. Many companies still prefer men for some type of work rather than women. For example, when I graduated university
 and went to the interview and 
the first question of interviewers
 was the 
“When I 
planning to get married?”. This one
 of the gender inequalities we have in our Uzbek society and this society gives more attention and opportunity for

 I
 addition to this, the men consist of the breadwinner and this view cannot be change
 for more time. They have also more duty to breed their family, but 
not just their children and spouses but also their parents. 

On the other hand, fatherhood play
 vital
 role in the

 their

 physically and emotionally. Many researchers have proved that fatherly love is one the
 important aspects in
 the
 healthy family. Child
 which grows up in healthy conditions don’t
 have social problems. Besides this
 they can easily find they
 spot in the society. For instance, my cousin’s mother is the second wife. Father
 of my cousin has first
 family and children. He had tried to spend more his
 free time with the
 first family, so my cousin grow
 up in this condition and her character is
 little
 difficult. She always wants to be in the center
 of the group and require
 more attention from other people. She became unconfident. 

Overall, fatherhood is 
vitally
 important 
aspects
 in

 The Experience gained through studying in schools like recongnition
 of objects or pencil holding and grip on it cannot be learnt on our screens.Thus most valuable practical lessons are learnt offline.

Furthermore
 many empathic lessons are only gained in group settings for example sharing,caring for other emotions,respect for elders and social service to society is
 only practiced physically and though taught online dose'nt
 have that same impact.Even if a baby see
 them everday
 can't understand the concept without experiencing it.Further
 a child may recognize an object online but may not react to it if seen physically. For example, there is a disesase
 called screen autisim
 in which child
 understand the
 object or animal or identify
 colors on t.v
 but not in front of it.

On th
 contrary Many objects which are harmful in their natural settings like wild animals or many off season
 fruits and vegetable
 can be taught in this way,thus a kin can have a knowledge
 on
 it with out
 its access.It not only save
 money but also time and also can help parents to focus on their work while the child is watching it on scree
. For example
 many documentry
 channels like national geographic
 provide first hand
 experience to the viewer.

To conclude,I personally believe that in hand expeirence

Excessive consumerism, driven by a culture of materialism and economic growth, contributes significantly to climate change. Despite growing awareness, governments have been slow to implement policies that promote sustainable consumption and production. This inertia allows corporations to prioritize profits over environmental concerns, perpetuating the cycle of consumption and pollution.

Pollution, particularly from industrial activities, exacerbates the effects of climate change by emitting greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants. While some governments have introduced measures to reduce emissions, such as carbon pricing, these efforts have often been insufficient due to political inertia and vested interests.

In conclusion, while climate change is recognized as a grave threat, political action to address the root causes of excessive consumerism and pollution is lacking. To effectively combat climate change, governments must prioritize environmental sustainability and implement policies that promote responsible consumption and production. Only through concerted political action can we hope to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.

 delve into the problem caused by this trend and suggest some practical solution
 to address this issue.

First and foremost, one of the obvious problems caused by this trend is unhealthy dieting is on the increase. In other words, many young females are starving to loose
 weight and become thin, as a consequence, they are in the clutches of illness. For example, a new young model dead
 due to the 
overfasting

body women are being insulted and body shamed
. The poeple

misconsumption
 that fat body is due to the intake of over 
food consumption, in turn, these fat young females are insulted publically and private parties become commonplace.

Nevertheless, there are some practical solution
 to tackle this issue to a great extend
. Firstly, proper guidance should be provided for the 
young people to diet and loose
 body weight. In detail, health education should be provided by not only health authorities but also  universitites
. The awareness for
 the 
proper dieting would reduce this issue. The authorities should be 
make strict laws and guidance to

 about  body shaming and harassment. By doint
 this the mental harassment for
 fat women can be reduced significantly.

 of the thin-body fashion concept. similarly, mental harassment is the 
another negative effect of this trend. Ergo, proper diet education and implementation of strict laws are the practical solutions to address this

 it is better to live in urban or rural areas. This essay will discuss both views alongside with 
my own opinion on each notion. 

On the one hand, living in big cities grants people an 
easy access to top-tier facilities. It is inevitable that the privilege of urban people lays
 on
 the easy accessibility from
 advanced public facilities such as hospitals that heightens
 the opportunity of
 people to live a better life. It can be seen from several cases that can be found in capital cities like Seoul or Jakarta, where people easily perceive detail and comprehensive medical examinations as well as treatments, supported by sophisticated equipment,
 since to reach those facilities people only require to make an ambulance call, once they suffer from certain symptomps
. As a result, it can deter the percentage of people who likely
 to experience chronic diseases, which in turn increasing
 life expectancy and decreasing
 death tolls. Regardless that
 view; however, I disagree that reside
 in big cities is a beter
 option since it can be unsafe as the criminal rates are particularly higher.

On the other hand, having an
 outskirts live
 can make people physically and mentally healthy. Notwithstanding with 
an
 eminent fact that there is a likelihood its people will be provided with better air quality since there is a scarcity to find gasoline-based vehicles, which being
 the biggest threat to human’s
 respiratory systems, rural areas also prompt a condition that support
 better mental health conditions to human beings because it drift
 them apart from the typical hustle and bustle conditions in big cities. This notion is supported through a recent survey from NHS that unveil
 almost
 76% of British people are likely live
 in rural areas compared to big cities because they feel mentally and phsyically
 better. As a result, it can increase people’s life satisfactions
 and hinder them from the 
potential psychological disturbance
 such as stress or depression. Regarding that notion, I agree with the decision to live in rural areas because it can benefit to 
the health levels of people in the long run. 

In conclusion, even though reside
 in big cities gives privilege
 to easily reach top-tier facilities for a better quality of life, it is not foreshortened the fact that people’s safety is also at risks
 with the higher rates of criminal activities. Therefore, I deem to

 a breadth  of roles which makes  the employee be

#aim
#development
#values","A lot of people opt to improve their quality of life through economic growth. As a result, some crucial social values are lost. However, I think the merits of economic development outweigh the demerits. 

To begin with, economic growth has several advantages. First, it is beneficial to improve education level. To be specific, as a country becomes economically successful, the government can invest more money on
 education. Thus, it empowers the individual's knowledge. Consequently, the number of well-educated workforce increases. Moreover, as the economy grows, healthcare services will also improve. Hence, economic development is a focal point of developing overall
 well-being of the nation. 

However, not all aspects of this trend are advantageous. The more the economy becomes successful, the more individuals lose their social values. To illustrate, for business achievement, people should work overtime and thus, it culminates in reduced family time and socializing opportunities. For instance, South Korea, which experienced  dramatic economic success, always rank highly in working hours. Hence, economic accomplishment is not always favourable to society. 

In my view, the most paramount aim of the society should be protecting the vulnerable. Therefore, although economic development brings some disadvantages, it is highly beneficial as it guarantees  overall well-being, which positively effects  
vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and children. 

To conclude, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the shortcomings of the 
economic growth because it is favourable to attract investment towards  healthcare and education facilities, which is consequently helpful to  socially disadvantaged groups.

 can not overshadow its disadvantage
.

Without a shadow of a doubt, some school leavers choose to take a trip as well as find a job that does more harm than good. And the
 explanation for this could be that spending a year working before going to academy
 leads to 
people to concentrate too much on work because of the high salary, which causes them to ignore the importance of study
. For instance, working as a part-time employee at a famous clothing store namely Uniqlo, which doesn’t require a college degree but still has a comparatively stable income. However, this occupation can not be embarked for
 a
 long term. In addition, travelling also costs a fortune, which is considered a financial burden for the family because high school graduates don't make any money yet. Thus, taking a gap year for travelling or working
 brings
 tremendously
 influence on people

While the demerits of taking a year off between school and university are widely acknowledged, it is unfair if its merits are ignored because travelling and working do wonders for people in some aspects of life. This is due to the fact that people are able to blow off some steam after an intimidating studying year before entering the
 new school. For example, travelling to new lands is a way to not only relieve stress but also absorb more knowledge such as cultures
 of different nations or new languages. Moreover, working part-time also helps people gain more soft skills like communication skill
 or solving-problem skill
. Hence, working or travelling are
 immensely beneficial to people.

In conclusion, taking a year off to travel or working
 allows people to chill out, however, it can also act as an adversity for people when they come back to the institution.

 and good taste of fast food; the consumption of junk meals is rising according to studies but it also brings negative effects on our health in the long run. I am completely agree
 withthe
 statement that it is bad for human well-being.

To commence with, the use of frozen edibles is always injurious to health. People opt for it because it is less time consuming
 and due to hectic work schedules they can make it easily. However, due to such bad habits, we make compromises with our health and face bad consequences. According to many studies, snacks cause obesity among young people. For example; according to a report by the World Health Organisation youngsters of age
 18 to 35 are caused with
 obesity because of over-consumption of an 
oily and packed food. Therefore, it also becomes the reason of
 many other serious diseases related with
 heart
 as well.

Moreover, dehydrated food does not hold the nutritious values that are necessary for the human body. Eatable things that are in packets from
 a
 long-run
 can not preserve all the vitamins and minerals that are present in fresh and home-made food. Besides that, bacterial contamination is another cause that made
 it injurious to human
 body. There are many bacterias
 found in outside eatables which cause food poisoning and later on resulted
 in serious illness. For example; a recent case of a little girl, who ate the cake and it caused her death because of food poisoining
 in Punjab, India. Thereore
, people should avoid to buy
 bread from outside shops because those people only think about their own profit, not about the lives of others.

Commencing, most of the fathers and mothers are grafting at least six days in 
a week and taking long shifts such as 12 to 16 hour
 shifts.Additionally, without doing this, it will be a problem so 
that they cannot afford to feed their adolescents and not even buy them clothes or electric gadgets.Meanwhile
 a child is always demanding, others wants
 to go to
 vacation and as a parent
 you have to pay tuitions
 all the time to keep them growing wisely.Furthermore, mostly
 juveniles are in trouble,
 because they are spending most of their time without their parents which can cause loneliness diseases, since parents are always at work.A very good example to mention is that,
 those who are based in the UK, for a family to survive, they must graft 24/7 to get enough salary which covers bills, transport, insurance as well as food.

Moreover, many teens are always stay 
without someone who can look after them, this is because some of 
current parents are studying whilst they are getting old.An example to illustrate that could be  people in my native country Zimbabwe, some of these family members travel to Poland and England to study nursing degree for about three years.Thus, they did this in the  sense that they can support their teenagers in the long run but at the same time children will be alone in Africa.This is clear that a toddler need
 his or her parent to grow up with discpline
 and will not suffer from depression while thinking of their parents.

To conclude, in the world, parents are always work
 and save money for their future lives, however, their chidren
 are suffering from loneliness due to the fact that they spend less time with their parents.

pressure has been a subject of debate with controversial approaches. Some people claim that subjects which do not have any positive impacts on individuals’ academic lives and knowledge should be taken off from the school systems, however, I am not at
 the same side with them. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will elucidate both aspects and try to give a reasonable conclusion from my viewpoint. 

First and foremost, proponents of the idea which is about to remove
 non-academic subjects from school
 syllabus allege that these subjects do not matter in pupils’ education, they see these kinds of classes as a waste of time. For instance, students who participate in these classes can be attracted by these kind
 of activities, as
 a result of
 it
, students may ignore other subjects in order to show great performances and enhance their skills related to these fields. Moreover, if someone has innate skills and is the best among their peers, they can be directed to these sectors by the 
professionals, and in the long run
 they will not have any time for their education.

Turing
 to the other side of the coin, it is an inevitable fact that importance
 of co-educational branches of study are
 various. To exemplify, students need breaks and refresh their minds between tiring classes to concentrate on each subject well, while some can do it easily during the breaks, for others engaging in physical activities can be more effective as it promotes some individuals with a sense of fulfilment, relaxation and being away from the stress. Additionally, naturally gifted students can gain experience and improve their skills by attending these kinds of branches.

In conclusion, after being manifested both points, while some people are convinced that the subjects which are not related to academic studies should be eliminated from the list of subjects, I am absolutely against to 
this attitude. From my point of view, all subjects are important for students and it is ideal to strike a balance between both academic and physical courses of study.

#effects","The lifestyle of people has changed worldwide in the past few years. The most notable observation from this change is the increased number of individuals with obesity. This trend is predominantly caused by alternative food options that results
 in a poor diet, which can cause numerous medical implications. Hence, this essay will examine the cause
 and effect
 of obesity. 

Alternative food options like fast food restaurants or pre-cooked meals can be a convenient and time saving
 option, however
 these options will most likely cause obesity when misused.   For example, one meal at McDonalds
 contains more calories than the average amount of calories an individual is recommended to consume daily. Moreover, most supermarkets nowadays sell pre-cooked meals that are unfortunately stacked with preservatives that can also lead to obesity. Thus, fast food restaurants and ready meals cause a poor diet, which gives rise to obesity. 

Obesity can put enormous amounts of stress on the health of an individual. For instance, the medical board at Montana Hospital recently found that 80% of the cardiovascular patients at the hospital are overweight. Given this, patients with heart diseases, due to obesity, are often accompanied with
 knee and back problems. Hence, there are serious medical effects that can hinder a person when overweight. 

In conclusion, fast food restaurants and pre-cooked meals can contribute to a poor diet, which will result in obesity if used excessively. This will eventually result in medical conditions that can effect
 the lifestyle of a person. If this trend is not stopped, then more frequent medical complications will arise in the foreseeable future.

#people","Museums are international destinations that can be located in almost every town around the globe. Given this, they can be in the form of an antique heritage site or a modern state of the art
 building. Museums can serve for a number of reasons, but it is largely attributed for
 its
 contribution to education and entertainment. 

Firstly, museums have the ability to showcase centuries of history in one setting. For example, The Cradle of Human Kind
 Museum offers educational programs about the evolution of human beings, which stretches over a thousand years. Additionaly
, such educational museums can be extremely beneficial for learners who have learning disibilties
, given that almost all learning styles are met during such programs. As a result, museums have the ability to transform the learning experience for students and adults into a much more enjoyable experience. 

Secondly, museums can be more than just a page from history,
 but also serve as entertainment. For instance, Space X Museum allows individuals to participate in gravity stimulation machines, that resembles
 space walking
. Through these types of technological attractions, individuals can experience a glimpse what
 the future has to offer; establishing an interest to contribute and evolve
 our planet. Hence, museums that offer entertainment facilities can instil motivation for young children and even adults to go after their dreams. 

In conclusion, the educational and entertainment purposes of museums both have strong support. Although, if museums put more emphasis on the sole purpose of educating poeple
, then it will largely benefit future generations. Thus, I feel that the main focus of museums should be to educate people.

The level of turnout in the elections between
 the young population is not high. Therefore, politicians should consider the changes required in the current election system, so the number of voters is increased.

The minimum age to vote currently is 18. Some studies have suggested that reducing the voting age to 16 could influence changing routine habits with respect to participation in balloting. 16-year-olds still live with their parents and thanks to the parents' influence the probability of using the right to vote could increase dramatically, Nevertheless, enabling teenagers to vote may contribute to the creation of new routines with respect to voting again in elections. 

On another note, this population should be able to make decisions about issues that would affect them soon. In addition, politicians should start including more questions that may affect teens in their campaigns. 

In conclusion, the minimum age for voting should be reduced to 16, as this way this part of the society would feel considered to make decisions that would affect their future. Although some people claim that they are still too young to commit, studies have shown that earlier participation in the elections could contribute to continue
 involvement in the forthcoming times, improving participation rates among the youngest.

 it can be a more effective way of learning as well as gaining more income,others,including me,believe that the major aim in
 museums should become to educate people because  it is for gaining deeper understanding and broadening horizons of people,not for entertaining .

On the one side,it is widely believed by some that  the museums should become entertainment place
 as it can be beneficial for both the museum and individuals as well.Firstly,if the museums serve as an entertainment centre,it can attract many people to there.Consequently, people can obtain more income,which can advantageous
 for the economy of the country.For example,there are many museums in United
 States which serve as an enjoyment
 place and more and more visitors come there for entertainig
 and increased revenue can be procured.Secondly,it is also can be beneficial for individuals as it can learn about artifacts
 and other historical objects in more
 effective way.As going to museums may be boring for residents,turning them into enjoying places can attract many people to go the museums for learning .By learning about these objects in an amusing way ,individuals can aware
 of history without feeling bored.

On the other hand,I would side with those who believe that the main purpose of museums is to inform people,not to amuse
.I believe that the 
museums should enrich the knowledge of visitors and give accurate information about the  history of the 
artifacts
 or other historical objects.In this case,people can gain accurate knowledge about these objectsand
 can appreciate the importance of them ,which can lead to a more educated society. 

Taking everything into account,the question of whether the 
museums should serve as an 
amusement centre
 or educational instution
 has valid points on both sides.However,it seems to me that their main aims
 should be to inform people as
 they can acknowledge the importance of their history as well as broadening

#people
#population
#governments
#society","Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned that people’s life
 is
 longer than before, while others consider this a positive phenomenon. From my perspective, an ageing population does more harm than good.

I recognize that people living longer can have some advantages. Specifically, the elderly often possess traditional skills, which are symbols of traditional culture. If older people pass away at a young age, the youth may lose the opportunity to learn these skills or methods from them. For instance, many traditional African living devices and skills are being lost nowadays because the locals die at a young age, and young residents such as children or teenagers have no chance to learn.

However, it is true that the potential by-products of this phenomenon are
 adverse impacts on the public, and they overtake the benefits. This is because an ageing population signifies a reduction in the social labor
 force, which is a necessary part of our society. For example, in some countries, there are more and more elderly residents, as
 a result, their countries’ productive forces are declining. The loss of productive force may cause a financial crisis or other difficulties. Moreover, an ageing population could put significant pressure on governments, such as addressing health and policy problems. It is obvious that most elderly individuals’ physical conditions are worse than those of younger people. To solve this problem, the government has to spend more money on health facilities, resulting in less investment in other aspects that are crucial for a country’s development.

In conclusion, every coin has two sides, and so does the ageing population. Nevertheless, the advantages are relatively minor compared to the multiple disadvantages. Thus, I believe that an ageing population brings more cons than pros.

There are a group of jobs which need continuing  instruction and research to stay in competition in a globe containing moderately changing data and technology. Although some people believe that cash should be up to the person who does the office others, myself included , take the view that the business has the duty to spend money on it.

The trade needs to take the responsibility to give salary to training so they can gain the trust of their staff. The members of the staff need to know the fact that the people who have major roles in the work care about them and what they do. The employment needs to make the workers believe that they want them to improve and get better. If not paying for the sustained teaching and training which can be impactful for the potential trainees` improvement , they may start losing their hope for the work and eventually quit. What the wage does is to 
strengthen the relationship between all individuals working for
 the field as they can count on each other more.

Some people argue that It is the employee`s duty to deal with the financial part of their continuing instruction for the independence of the institute .It has been believed that getting better in a position depends on the will and the actions of the person who does the career. If  necessary , training should be done by the potential trainees even with  financial barriers. Thus It is said to have affected their level of self-reliance. However, I think cash by the individual cannot be a bridge for an 
improvement as it weakens the communication and the cooperation of the staff. It is  common knowledge that progression in business can be seen by teamwork and the level of trust.  Consequently, members of staff can't bring anything to the table for progression.

In conclusion , I am not convinced that staff should be responsible for giving award
 to train as it has a negative effect on cooperation which is a key role for every profession. I take the view that the employment
 should take  responsibility for the repayment as they can receive the trust of staff.

#effect","Some argue that people are changing their electronic devices such as smartphones and computers more frequently these days without any reasons
. There are some reasons why this phenomenon is occurring, and I think that this situation has a negative impact on society. 

To begin with, there are several reasons why people often change their electronic products. Firstly, the development of social media is one of the main factors. People used to upload what they have on their social media, showing expensive or fancy items they own. The frequent
 exposure of
 social media will make individuals to 
have a desire for the ownership of fancy products. It leads to an 
unnecessary spending to
 customers indirectly. In addition, trend
 is another key factors
 of this phenomenon. Young generations are sensitive for
 following a trend. For example, if possessing an iPhone is considered as 
“rizz
”, young people want to change their items regardless of purposes
. 

In
 my perspective, I firmly believe that this contemporary situation has been 
influenced on 
the 
society negatively. First of all, it can lead to an overconsumption. If people kept
 buying electronic devices regardless of their financial situation, they eventually will be indifferent of
 spending money. The more people do not care about their financial situation, the more people become poor, resulting in the society
 problem. Moreover, it can contribute to the harmful effect on the environment. Many materials which play a negative role in the environment were used to produce electronic devices. Governments or
 authorities worldwide are trying their best to recycle materials from electronic products for the sake of protecting the 
nature. 

In conclusion, I firmly believe that current
 situation has a significantly negative impact on society. It is imperative for not only individuals but also governments or authorities to perceive the bad effects of their behaviours. Furthermore, governments should provide a lot of information which explain
 about 
the impact so that people can aware
 the
 seriousness of what they are doing and change their behaviour.

 devices. It is completely agreed that  the lack of physical exercise and eating unhealthy diets is the main reason of
 obesity. This essay will discuss both causes and solutions before constructing an inference.

One cause of obesity is excess
 eating habit
 of junk food from the markets, which contains more energy and fats. Another factor is the  lack of physical exercise, teenagers after school come at home and play video games and watch television. They spend all time
 sitting at home in front of screens, which effects
 on 
their brain and health. For example, recently a  report printed from the Blacktown Hospital, New South Wales, 25% of students are suffering with
 obesity and anxiety. As a result, it is evident that undergraduates do not  listen from
 their parents and getting
 fat.

The best solution is that 
physical activities such as sports and swimming. Parents should send their tutees to play games and do physical exercises. In addition, make a time table
, so pupil
 can follow that table and perform tasks accordingly.Moreover, add healthy
 diet in
 their daily routine food. Furthermore, take them for picnic
 and hikings
 once in 
a month, so they can physical
 fit and mix with other peers. For instance, Elon Musk, confirmed in an interview that  his children are following 
strick
 time table
. As a consequence, it is apparent why his family is so healthy.

In conclusion, following the analysis causes
 and solutions, it is clear that teachers and parents should put hard rules and regulations on sophomores, so they  can get rid of obesity and live a happy life. Further, it is predicted that this development will continue in the future as well if we did

What problems does this cause? And what are the solutions","#people
#employment","These days, the old population who need occupation have to conflict with the young ones. I think this difficulty causes a number of problems such as economic issues, to
 solve these government action is essential.

To begin with, jobs are important for people, especially elder citizens because they have families to care for and also some spend the same on study fees and loan charges and 
to tackle these issues they need a position to work in. Although, it is becoming a challenging duty because they have to compete with younger employees. Moreover, younges
 are fresher and they have more power also they can learn more easily compared to old ones. As a result, aged adults have to reduce their expectancies and apply for lower positions so they will not do their main major. Consequently, they will earn less  struggle with hardships and have to work more hours to respond to their basic needs.

 

To tackle these problems, authorities have to introduce roles to support that generation same
 as free insurance or stable monthly payment
 that can cover all basic needs. For example, in some developed countries when a person reaches his/her middle age they can have access to various types of functions that are provided by governments same
 as scholarships for their children , and free healthcare so these people will compete less and enjoy more  life.

In conclusion, nowadays getting a job is a challenging matter for the aged population and they have to deal with economic issues. However, I think this could be tackled by acts of governments by introducing some roles to cover their needs.

#pole","The allure of remote natural environments, such as the South Pole, has captivated the imaginations of scientists and tourists alike. While venturing into these pristine landscapes offers unique opportunities for discovery and adventure, it also presents challenges and potential risks. In this essay, I will evaluate whether the advantages of traveling
 to remote natural environments outweigh the disadvantages.

On one hand, exploring remote natural environments provides invaluable opportunities for scientific research and discovery. These regions often harbor
 unique ecosystems and geological formations that offer insights into Earth's history and the dynamics of our planet's natural processes. For scientists, studying these environments can lead to groundbreaking discoveries in fields such as climate science, geology, and biodiversity conservation. Moreover, the data collected from these expeditions can inform policies and strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change and preserving fragile ecosystems.

Additionally, traveling
 to remote natural environments fosters a deeper appreciation for the natural world and promotes environmental stewardship. Experiencing the pristine beauty and vastness of these landscapes firsthand can inspire individuals to advocate for conservation efforts and sustainable practices. Furthermore, ecotourism in these regions can provide economic opportunities for local communities, supporting livelihoods while incentivizing the protection of natural resources.

However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential disadvantages and risks associated with traveling
 to remote natural environments. These regions often pose logistical challenges, including extreme weather conditions, limited access to medical facilities, and the need for specialized equipment and training. Furthermore, human activities in these fragile ecosystems can have detrimental impacts, including habitat destruction, pollution, and disturbance to wildlife.

In conclusion, while traveling
 to remote natural environments offers numerous advantages, including scientific discovery and environmental appreciation, it is crucial to approach such expeditions with caution and responsibility. By balancing the benefits with the potential risks and implementing sustainable practices, we can ensure that future generations continue to have the opportunity to explore and learn from these pristine landscapes.

From my point of view, this approach is quite correct. This essay will discuss whether the railway is the most useful mode of transport or not.

First of all, There are a lot of  superiority and drawbacks to using transport or being there. The railway is one of the underground transports
 that is convenient for people in unfavorable
 weather conditions. In terms of other types of movements, all of them are influenced by rain or fog. That is why, based on statistics, following a 30-year period most persons
 are likely to choose the railway for going somewhere. Another advantage of using it, you can go faster than with other kinds of movements. For instance, if you drive a vehicle, there can be some rushing. However, Nobody can see some traffic on the railway during peak hours. Also, in the contemporary world, cars may be more susceptible to theft or accidents. Considering all of these benefits, using the railway can be more safely and quicker.

Secondly, turning to the drawbacks of the railway, there may be several people, and it can make someone feel uncomfortable or anxious. For example, we hear every day that someone fainted because there was not enough oxygen for everyone. Accidents like that can make sense of frustrating
 for people using them. Nevertheless, these accidents only happens
 to people who suffer from certain diseases. We always advise them not to engage in this type of movement as much as you can.

In conclusion, I reckon that the railway is a very beneficial mode of transport for all time. Also, it is for persons who are healthy to take a breath. Thus, railways are a very optional choice for almost everyone.

Firstly, in our digital age , processed food become ubiquitous, in social media , TV shows , and street banners advertising  processed products . However , the daily consumption of food suggesting sugar, overwhelmingly affects our health system .For instance ,  According to  researchers from UK Cambridge University ,  80% of youngsters living in the USA , suffer from obesity , which is the main disease that sugar causes. Furthermore , processed food suggests glucose that lessens our energy and accounts drop in testosterone for men . 

However, some individuals argue that , 
growth in prices of processed crop

 solving the problem . From their perspective , rapid increase in costs of processed products may lessen their sale ratios by helping people to remove sugar from their diet . 

There is an undeniable fact that it will drop the

 achieving success in sports. This essay will discuss both sides of argument
 and provided
 my own stance. 

It is not possible to discuss sports without mentioning physical status, at the same time, any form of sports all 
requires certain
 extent of good physical fitness, even the easiest-looking jogging. The strength of muscles and the ability to control for 
breath and heart rate, many
 physical-related factors that can make one stand out in competition
. Hence, as an atheles
, besides specialized skills, it is definitely essential to have strong
 physical condition in order to compete with other well-prepared individuals who also aiming
 for achievements in their domain. 

However, on the other hand, stable
 mental attitude is a crucial element for any kind of activities
, not to mention sports as well. Facing challenge
 career time or accidents is unavoidable for sportsmen. Ignoring what consequences mental attitude can result in is a problem. Take the most successful footballer in my opinion, Messi, as an example, in 2014, losing
 the final game of 
world cup
, he had 
became the one to blame for every argentinian
, with endless harassment and insults. However, with strong
 mind and dedication he didn't give up and win
 back the trophy eight years later, this demonstrated the importance of mental status. Thus, it is doubtful for a talented sportman
 who broke down easily to achieve any postive
 outcome. 

In conclusion, from my perspective, both arguements
 are understandable; moreover, these two elements are indeed inseperable
. Therefore, with great
 certain extend
 of physical finess
 and mental attitude, atheles
 might be closer and easier to achieve their goals.

 both having place
 in funny acts and getting some details from the books. In my opinion, learning something while doing in 
lively by touching or feeling is more creative in comparison with trying to understand from books in an imaginary world.

To begin with, nowadays so many different activities are accessible for children as of
 the beginning of little ages that they can improve their visual and physical abilities. For example, children are able to learn playing
 with toys which are
 beneficial for their intelligence during pre-school or be
 a member of a sport
 team whilst they are a 
teenager
 can develop their movement abilities and power of the body.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that reading opens new worlds in children’s memories and contribute
 to their capabilities which are solving a problem, giving a quick response, improving point
 of view for the situations and so on. However, it might be limited without being in an event or seeing with their own eyes one by one. For instance, watching cartoons cannot be explained sufficiently unless a child watches it on television instead of reading a 
fairy tale books with pictures.

Finally, it is the best practice that if it is established
 an environment around children including fun and theoretical learning together, this concept boosts kids’ skills in a
 best way.

To conclude, regardless of how beneficial reading a book is for kids, this cannot bring enough skill to them. Learning while enjoying stays much more in their memories in terms of gaining better creativity and capability.

 the opinion that it should be considered illegal to perform scientific experiments on these animals. In this essay, I will delve into whether these
 experimentation is justifiable and further explore other options in the name of science.

To start, due to the ever-changing landscape of viruses around us, it is inevitable that scientists test out new scientific studies to keep abreast our
 knowledge of what is going on. These studies, if results
 in a positive and successful outcome will be well on its
 way to becoming vaccines which will help to save millions of lives. However, before that production stage, experimentations have to be begin trying
 out on animals first, due to a law implemented against companies for carrying out human trials before animals
 trials. Although,
 it might seem as
 a form of cruelty to some people, it is absolutely essential. With some animals having almost similar genetic material as humans, being successful in these trial
 will provide enough evidence for the vaccine to work in humans as well. For instance, in the COVID-19 global pandemic, due to successful results from carrying out vaccines
 trials on laboratory rats, that is why many lives across the world was
 saved.

On the other hand, as animal rights activist
 are calling for the scientific community to impose a law to make it illegal for animal
 to suffer in place of humans, we should explore whether there are viable alternatives. In gist, there is only main
 consideration to keep a mind out for, the genetic material. Are
 there anything out there that have
 a similar makeup as humans for experimentation to be able to apply if its
 successful.
 This alone,
 narrows down the search to a handful of animals, most commonly used are lab rats and chimpanzees. For example, should the 
COVID-19 be performed on a duck, it will not be able to consider
 as 
safe for people due to dissimilarity
 of DNA.

To end, in the name of science and the human race, the exploration into the unknown, especially diseases, I believe that studies have to be carried out on animals in place of humans, due to legality issues. Although, It might seem cruel but 
no other alternatives are as compatible as certain species from the animal kingdom which will be pivotal as we discover new medicine.

First and foremost , there are numerous number of 
people assume
 that arts mean only paintings . Moreover  in this modern world in AI
 era , People are worried that companies and organisations will not recruit any artist
. This is one of the reason 
, people think that art does not give any benefit to their life . 

In my opinion , art does not mean only paining

 such as music , painting and writing . Every schools
 in the world , they 
always provide art class
 with a varieties
 of painting supplies . Even the aged
 of 3 to 4  years old children have to learn how to paint . Painting keeps the children calm down and help
 them to concentrate more . Moreover ,painting enhances their creativity . Holding brush
 , looking at the canvas and thinking idea
 at the same time help the children multitask . This help
 achieve a lot of things in their lives. 

Another form of art is music ,music can make people happy and help when they are under stressed 
. Dancing with music increases physical workout and burns fat and calories . A good example of art and workout  is Zumba which has been recognised as physical
 workout and well known
 program .

In modern
 world , there has been huge
 demand for designers with a strong sold of artistic mind to attract the audience in digital marketing . Since art is an emotion and creativity  , AI can not replace it . 

Therefore ,above my explained ideas ,  I believe that art plays vital
 role in the world . People should not consider art as a waste of time and energy . Art can not be replaced and
 reproduced . Governent
 should help artist

 that women and men are both responsible for housework and if the home job is segregated well is a good sign of equality amongst both the 
genders. I here believe the latter.

On the one hand, The belief of the old society in my country, India, is because of the patriarchal way of thinking that that 
was established because men were the bread earners in the early century and thus, women stay
 home for food, safety and managing home chores. however, as society became progressive, women were encouraged to work, and this led tol

. To exemplify, As per the Hindustan times
 the 
report in 2009 on family welfare, says that, Working women tend to be happier which led
 to overall
 happiness of the family.

Although, Women staying at home had benefits like childcare but
, the Disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Women staying at home didn't aquire
 much
 skills and they tend to have low confidence and lesser self esteems
. For instance, In society
 a bread earner is regarded as the head of the family and this led to women sacrificing in their marraige
 as they were solely homemakers and they had to depend on the other gender for their basic needs. Thus, managing home chores and finances helps men and women to work like equals, it also gives opportunity to the males to spend more time with family and have a balanced life. 

To conclude, I am in support of working women and working men sharing equal responsibilities of home chores this will led
 to equality and a balanced life amongst both the 
genders.

#statment
#reason","Several individuals prefer working for long hours and as a result, they don’t get enough time for leisure activities. Making a good career and creating a competitive edge over colleagues are the biggest advantage
 while mental health issues and developing bad habits are the primary disadvantages of this phenomenon.

To commence with, nowadays competition in the job market is fierce, and it is very difficult for employees to get promotion
 or find a job with a good salary. Therefore, to sustain the job they have and to get a raise, workers often choose to work beyond their regular job hours. Consequently, employees who show more dedication towards their job by working for long hours, create a competitive edge over their colleagues. For example, as per the
 recent study, most managers tend to have a positive image for
 employees who work after job hours. 

Although working for more hours is advantageous for better career prospects, it shouldn’t be prioritized at the cost of leisure and fun activities. To explain in detail, leisure activities like light exercise, going for small trips, spending
 quality time with family all have a significant impact on physical and mental well being
. Since many people suffer from mental health issues due to long working hours, they start smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol to cope with the stress. This is why, working for long hours is not recommended when mental and physical health get compromised.

In conclusion, even though spending extended hours at work may increase the chances of getting promoted or getting a pay raise, its adverse effects on mental and physical health should be taken into consideration while
 deciding to work for long hours. Additionally, developing the habit of drinking and smoking to reduce the 
stress at work is never a good option either in the short run or in the long run.

 it is beneficial to construct modern museums and town buildings other
 than renovating the outmoded ones. I strongly agree that new museums should be built as it
 will provide more space and include modern architecture which will be accessible to visitors and also great jobs for the community. 

There are many advantages of building museums and town centres. Firstly, the construction of new facilities incorporates modern design and technology and providing
 more accessible space. This attracts tourists as they are intrigued by the design and will like to explore the area as there will facilities
 for visitors to enjoy their stay at the museum. For instance, the building of Kwame Nkrumah historical museum
 in Ghana included great artifacts
 and has increased its amenities to include many modern departments such as the library, restaurants, exhibition halls etc. Also, due to its expansion and facility, many local people have been employed in various fields and this has reduced the unemployment rate. 

On the other hand, people affirm that the old museum should be renovated because they believe renovating the old buildings will help maintain historical continuity and preserve cultural heritage. They believe that the history there will be lost when they are destroyed hence, keeping it with slight change is the best. In addition, it is believed that,
 preserving old buildings can foster a sense of identity. New
 generation will know their linage
 as the same history will be passed down to them.

In conclusion, construction
 of new museums and town halls opens enormous advantages to local residents and should be encouraged even though preserving historic buildings help

#team

#skills
#life","While some argue that group or team activities offer valuable life skills, I firmly disagree with this assertion. Because I believe that individual endeavours can impart equally,
 if not more, important life skills.

Admittedly, proponents of group activities often highlight the collaborative nature of such endeavours, suggesting that they cultivate teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. For example, working in a team setting can provide individuals with opportunities to learn how to cooperate, delegate tasks, and resolve conflicts effectively. This is mainly because group activities often simulate real-life scenarios where individuals must navigate diverse perspectives and work towards common goals.

However, it is essential to recognise that solo pursuits also offer invaluable life lessons. Undertaking tasks alone fosters self-reliance, independence, and accountability, all of which are crucial skills for navigating various aspects of life. While working independently, individuals must rely on their own judgement, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance to overcome challenges, in contrast to the approach of group activities. This self-reliance not only instills
 confidence and resilience but could
 also empower individuals to tackle obstacles with determination and resourcefulness.

A further advantage, somewhat related to the one mentioned above, is that solo activities provide opportunities for deep introspection and personal growth. When working alone, individuals do 
have the freedom to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and discover their strengths and weaknesses without external influences. This self-discovery is especially integral to developing a strong sense of identity and purpose, thereby laying the foundation for personal fulfilment and success in life. In addition, individual pursuits often require a high degree of focus and concentration, so  honing essential skills such as time management, organisation, and critical thinking is equally important. 

In summarising up
, although group activities undoubtedly offer valuable opportunities for collaboration and interpersonal development, I contend that solo endeavours can teach equally important life skills. Self-reliance, independence, personal growth, and critical thinking are just a few examples of the invaluable skills that individuals can acquire through individual pursuits. Therefore, I disagree with the notion that group activities are superior to imparting essential life skills.

 started to live way harder in modern society because it feels like the government doesn't solve the problems of crimes, murders, youth crime, etc. The government is reducing the money on some other things instead of protecting its population from some dangerous things that are spreading out more and more daily. 

For instance, I can say that analyzing some of the people who committed crimes, I can't really say that each of them lacked educational opportunities, they had a job, family, and everything that a common person can have in life, so I don't agree with a statement that it's about not having education, instead, I fully agree with that thieves have to have more help for their mental state. It supports the idea of abuse in lots of families in each country of the world, thieves don't need a reason for doing their crimes, but they totally have it on why they became like this. Eventually after abuse and not mentally stable people in life, the person can start to feel okay with doing something wrong, especially illegal. In addition to this, people through a lot of centuries tried to develop the police system, and as I see this situation it didn't really help in reducing crime in the world, because of lots of illegal businesses, millionaires, and billionaires who didn't under control of government and police, and the reason is money, also an opportunity on using weapons legally, etc. 

To sum up, I think people should have mental help, and the system doesn't need to punish those people physically, but instead work on their thoughts and find a reason for their crimes this way.

The main reason for such contrast is the influence of the environment on teenagers who acquire their upbringing, but another rising cause hides in the impact of social media as well. In the opinions of the majority of underage individuals, it is perceived as something that could be positively evaluated among their peers, but it also greatly depends on the delinquency itself since their family might experience financial issues or drown in debt, and adolescents usually find solutions by engaging in illegal acts or offenses

#points","Whether the outcome of resisting a training course is a well-qualified educator or not is a controversial discussion point. This writer agrees that academic years are not ideal to indicate good teachers but 
it 
must be considered
 about 
their experiences and personalities.

In the first place, it must be acknowledged that being a skilful teacher not only requires a good training lesson but also the experiences he or she has. It is obvious that a teacher has to be in charge of many other things relating to students rather than only teaching. To be more specific, a good teacher must know how to talk with students,
 and listen to their feelings in order to help them get further at school. For instance, teachers in LTT have to be really experienced in helping students since students have to deal with a huge amount of stress frequently.

However, some individuals believe that the most important factor that decides how well a teacher is is the program they resist. This belief might stem from the competitive job opportunities where schools are more focused on their employee's academic training courses. This might be true, but if teachers are only good at teaching and not well-equipped with communication skills, they will not be able to guide their class
 further because students also need mental support. As a result, their class will not make any progress and reduce the quality of future employees.

The writer of this essay argues that teachers
 personalities must also be taken into account. Yet, being exceptional at teaching but lacking of emotional side can have a negative impact on the whole class. To be clear, teachers have to be extremely patient so that they can understand  how their students are doing in class. Take NK as a contextual example, teachers here are trained with their patient skills due to the fact that many students have different studying paces.

In conclusion, a good training program is not the most suitable way to consider someone as a good teacher but it must also be for their teaching experiences and personalities. Hence, this essay has given clear points to support the idea that a good training course does not indicate a good tutor.

 of students from one city to another or abroad for their higher studies. The argument whether
 it is beneficial for children to spend their life away from their parents for education has been gathering momentum across the world in recent times. It is completely agreed that a quality education is must
 to shape one's life and for this, some folks leave their homes and move to another place and spend their life in the absence of their family. I will provide an overview on
 both advanvtages
 and disadvantages of this notion and will reach into 
a logical conclusion.

Firstly, when folks will 
live outside of their house, they will get chance
 to learn new skills everyday
 from their peers and it will be easy for them to mould according to different situations in their life in future when they will get marry
 and manage family
 and work life as living away will make them more independent and they will be responsible for their household chorus
 such as cooking, cleaning and managing their finances. Moreover, scholars will be able to enhance their interpersonal skills by taking part in social activities in universities, by
 joining different student clubs which in turn will increase the social network of pupils. For example, in hostel life, it is very easy to learn basic living rules such as get
 up early in the morning as one has to wait in the queue to take shower
 and for breakfast. It teaches folks to maintain daily
 routine, sense
 of sharing and keep patience while waiting in the queue for meals.

Secondly, staying at home has its own benefits as one can learn from the parents or ancestors. Emotional support is must
 during university life as some students feel stressed due to pressure
 of study
 and they feel embarrased
 to discuss with their peers or teachers which has given birth to many suicides in the past. Furthermore, living at home while studying can help to save money on accommodation and food and provide substantial financial relief to parents. 

To sum up, I believe that it is important to stay away from home while studying as it helps masses
 to participate in late night
 group activities or group studies happen 
in universities as it give
 chance
 to learn in more
 effective way rather than sitting alone and learning in the home.

#skills","One of the most prevalent trends in the contemporary world is the cumulative increase in interest to learn
 foreign language
 among people. The argument whether all four skills (listening, reading, speaking and writing) are equally important has been gathering momentum across the world in recent times. It is completely agreed that all these four skills are important when someone wants to survive where that language is used as 
nationwide. This stance will be proven by carefully analysing the benefits of all these four modules in day-to-day
 life of humans.

Firstly, one has to put a lot of efforts
 to learn
 reading and writing as they are very important to handle daily activities of life. Moreover, reading is an essential part and plays a big role when someone wants to sign any agreement or contract whereas writing makes it happen as it is not possible to make these documents without the knowledge of writing. For example, it is hard to understand the bills and buy basic groceries if someone is not able to read.

Furthermore, effective listening is a way to know the feelings of mankind and it is impossible to communicate without it. In addition to this, speaking is the primary part to convey
 your message to others and nobody can work without it. Moreover, it is quite necessary to ask for help in hard situations and one cannot make it without talking. For instance, doctor
 cannot help you if you won't
 ask for it and it is not possible without expressing it through your voice.

To sum up, it is crucial to learn all parts of the langauge
 to make every speech effective and it is not possible to push day to day
 activities of life without the 
effective communication and all these four parts.

school
 across all the countries of the world. Although these devices are useful in many ways but 
they have their own disadvantages as well. In this essay, I will overview both its merits and demerits and will reach to 
a logical conclusion.

Firstly, students used to study in traditional
 way where teachers used to teach everything on the black or white board and students were habitual to listen
 to them and action
 in certain way
 in questioning sessions. In this way, scholars were able to concetrate
 on the study as there were no ways to get distracted which seems like a positive affect
 if education institutes have restricted the use of phones. 

Moreover, now-a-days
 schools have changed they
 way of providing education to pupils. Educators are using technological devices like LCD screens or computers in classroom
 environment which is somehow taking the students away from the
 educations
 as educators are not able to go on
 every desk and check the work of their tutees. So, it is putting
 negative
 impact on the quality of education provided in the centre of learning.

To sum up, I believe that everything comes with some sort of advantages and disadvantages and it all depends on human being
 how that
 sources are utilised. As if the use of phone
 is beneficial in school
 environement
 as it can help student
 to understand today's tech world whereas it is taking away pupils from the 
quality education.

 a better life elsewhere. They are afraid of changing environment
 because they are used to their own type of lifestyle and they are afraid to move to new places where they would want to start learning and adapting to new lifestyle

On the other hand, there is a growing number of people who are not content with their local environment. These people are seen traveling
 from one place to another for different reasons, for instance, in search for
 good climatic conditions. We have seen a number of Europeans moving to Africa just to experience the good weather. Additionaly

the 
schools and teaching institutions use paper based
 exams to qualify the learning capacity and intelligence of the students. Therefore, this method brings a especial
 concern regardinf
 the efficacy and reliability of the examinations to assess students' capabilities.

I would like to start my argument by writing about the importance of the examminations
. People who are in favour of this method believe that, after teaching each subject, pupils should be assessed to determine how effective was the course and how much students learn from the subject. They claim that paper based
 tests are the best way because,
 all the students will be examined in a
 same and fair condition. Moreover, high quality
 exams are consist
 of different types of questions such as multiple choices and essay tasks that give test-takers almost enough information about each individual student.

On the contrary, people who oppose this kind of assessment argue that,
 students have different intellectual capacities and they should not be judged merely by taking paper exams. For instance, some of the students perform much better on group tasks, some have the ability to manage a team, and, some have better research skills. Thus, 
another
 types of evaluation techniques should also be considered. For example, group projects to determin
 teamwork ability or writing an essay to measure independand
 learning.

To summarize, based of
 what is mentioned above, the role of the 
formal pen and paper exams to assess
 students
 learning is undeniable. But, in addition to that, other forms of evaluations should be applied.

Firstly, migration to cities is no longer strange to developing countries. That' s
 easy to understand, People  always want to live in amenities and with villagers city is the nearest target. Let's take my country as an example, Rural residents moving from other provinces account for 3.38% of the urban population.  Compared to the period 2004-2009, the proportion of migration flow from rural to urban areas increased (44.2% compared to 30.5%), the
 proportion of migration flow from urban areas to urban areas decreased from 34.0%.  6% to 14.9%. Just

 some places there is a shortage of labor

at the same time the use of computers in every field has caused many people to lose their occupation

                   This revolution has affected mostly the low earning
 individuals.Firstly, the jobs of clerks and record keepers are severly
 affected.Previously, the companies had to hire a significant workforce for looking
 after the accounts and to keep the ledger uptodate

a 
data base
 resulting in the loss of employment for these professions.Similarly the 
typewriters have now become extinct with increased reliance on gadgetry.Moreover, the position of personal assistant has been abandoned and managers are on the verge of losing 
carreers

.Most people shifting to work on softwares
 and internet
 means that no paper is needed for printing.Also, the workers
 in printing
 press have declined significantly as news are
 read online these days.

 have other skills needed for employment which is making
 it difficult for them to look after the needs of their families.Many households have gone below the poverty line as they donot

#bicycle
#form
#transport","In recent years, people have preferred that 
riding bicycles to driving a car. There are tons of benefits and drawbacks of
 using bicycles as a main form of transport. in this essay, i
 will look at both sides and try to draw a conclusion. 

Let's begin by looking at the advantages of using bicycles. First of all, riding a bicycle regularly makes us more fit and healthy, because we move our muscles every
 way of our motion when we are riding a bicycle. Another outstanding point is save
 our time and cost of living. for example, in Mongolia there is a high traffic jams everyday
, thus riding a bicycle can prevent us from heavy traffic jams. As well as, we spend some of money
 for
 transportation. For taxi
, every meters
 costs money and for public transportation
 it is much cheaper than the taxi, however, public transportation can be uncomfortable at all. In addition to this, we spend much time to park
 our cars whereas bicycles are easy to park because of its
 size. Individuals
 that
 use cars, it can be expensive to buy cars and for 
using this car
 require
 fuels
 therefore, it causes unplanned expense
.

Turning to the other side of the argument, riding a bicycle can cause unemployment for
 every sector. For example, the company that makes cars can be in danger.  if public
 keen
 on bicycles more than cars, company's
 income can be gone
 down. Furthermore, engineering and mechanics lose their job
 due to bicycle usage. Also, drivers will lose their customers and public transportations
 too. so that, the government can be in danger either. Another disadvantage of riding bicycle
 is unsafe, the reason is the weather changing and precipitation. For example, in Mongolian
 unexpected weather changing
, bicycles cause accidents and the cars would be more suitable for long distance
 travel.

To wrap things up, the benefits of using bicycles outweigh the drawbacks of using bicycles. In my point of view, 
public
 have
 to use bicycles as much as they can. It can affect our well being

whether developed countries’ role 
to provide
 disasters
 relief with
 developing countries. This essay strongly agrees
 this statement because wealthier countries have advanced medical systems that can help many victims from
 natural catrophy
 such floods
, earthquake
 and tornado
. Another reason is that  natural disasters can happen anywhere and helping each other is a necessary humanilsm
 trait to create better relationship
 and bring a 
peace in the global.

To begin with, wealthy nations tend to have more developed health care systems which include high
 skilled and knowledgeable professionals. natural disaster
 can produce
 a lot of injured people and they often requires
 quality health care which allows to save
 so many citizens. For examples
, I have joined non-profit
 organisation which gathers health 
care professions
 such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists from over
 the world to help people who suffered from the massive floods in Indonesia few
 years ago. We helped lots of people with complex issues which local doctors could not deal with. our
 advanced care saved lots of peoples
 lives.

Secondly, natural disasters are not only happen
 to particular countries and
 it
 can happen anywhere else. Helping each other does not only help ensure our humanilsm
 but also build a good relationship globaly
. Instead of fighting each other like world wars, we should bring peace by supporting each other. For example, there was a devastating flood in 
philipines
 in 1988. Japanese goverment
 sent a lot of army to help the country from such a disaster providing food, medication and sunnitaries. since then, Japan and 
philipines
 have created a strong bond which brought our trade better and contract in a peace agreement which ensures not brought up
 wars.

In concision
, providing support from wealthy countries to poor countries is a must agreement in 
the 
global
 because developed countries have advances
 medical systems which can save victims
 lives and this brings a 
peace in
 the world by improving our relationship.

 it. In my opinion
 economic instability and governmental advertisements contribute to this situation. I am also convinced that home owners
 are more likely to benefit from privacy and economic success. Therefore, the benefits of purchasing a house override its drawbacks.

From my perspective, in some developing countries which face economic recession and high levels of inflation, citizens are compelled to buy a house. This may provide them with economic stability and prevent from 
financial issues in the future. For example, in Iran, the rent and price of properties are escalating alarmingly on a regular basis. Consequently, if people do not take steps towards owing
 a house, they will never afford it. Moreover, the interest rate of bank loans is increasingly going up and taking a loan can be challenging to some extent. On the other hand, since housing is a primary source of revenue for governments, they encourage people to purchase a house as soon as possible.

I further believe that owing
 a home is able to lift the burden from household’s
 shoulders. This enables them to tackle other problems and experience economic prosperity. For instance, they are likely to make ends meet and save money for their children’s education. Additionally, home owners
 are able to take full advantage of privacy and calm. This may result in boosting the quality of life and health levels.

In conclusion, the economic stability and the policy of governments convince people to buy a house instead of renting it. Also, I opine that the economic prosperity and privacy which associate
 with purchasing a house, it 
is a positive notion.

 of young people in any sports. This essay delves into both perspectives and personal beliefs about them. 

On one
 hand, the 
television shows make people become 
lazy. Television attracts audiences to stare on
 the screen for some moments. People will tend to watch television rather than being
 engaged in physical activities such as exercising, walking around on foot, and running. It will make
 a perception that watching television is already enough for doing exercise. Additionally, watching television is a lack of movement activity. 

On the other hand, some people believe that watching sports on television can shape the perspectives of the audience. It can turn some athletes into idols for the younger generation. For instance, Olympic champions Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu, who 
won the gold medal in the women's doubles sector of badminton at the Tokyo Olympics 2020. The impact of having athelets
 into
 idols is where
 sports arena
 are being fully booked by young people. They are attracted by athletes who won olympic
 gold medal
. This means sports channel
 on television effectively persuade young people to do any sports. 

In conclusion, while some people argue that television shows can make some individuals become lazy, it is essential for considering
 that sports television shows are also persuading the youth to participate in any sports. Therefore, audiences need to be wise while watching television. They can do some pureposeful
 physical activity instead of watching television, while also being inspired by athletes featured on television.

 cost of living. Which is becoming high and varies all over the world. Where the present lifestyle is more complex  than in the past. Then  the present industrial based
 economy changes the concept of life standards, such as education, houses’
 styles, clothes and food. As a result, those living standards
 costs become high according to the rapid economic changes. In addition, some people become jobholders to enhance their resumes because future employers will take note of multiple jobs on their resumes.

, working extra jobs has pros and cons. On the one hand, it enhances income. So it's an awesome way to get more money to satisfy all life aspects,
 or provide financial security. Besides, engaging in an aside job expands the professional network. Also, it contributes to a sense of stability when the worker feels mental well-being. On the other hand, working two jobs means constant pressure, which leads to exhaustion, lack of enough ordered sleep, and increased risk of stress. As a consequence,it can have
 serious health issues. Ultimately, working more than one job eats into leisure time, as well as leaves little room for personal life, social life, and hobbies.

  In conclusion, holding extra employment is a way to improve living and supply the 
incomes. also
 It helps in developing skills,mental well-being, and experiences. But,  it leads to less self-care and a healthy lifestyle due to time constraints.

#place","Some believe that proper behaviour should be taught at home, while others believe it should be taught in schools. It is my contention that parents are responsible for educating their children on how to become good members of society. However, this essay will discuss the influence improper behaved learners have on schools, even though schools should also encourage good manners. 

One paramount concern for teachers is the lack of good behaviour among learners. For example, High School Settlers recently reported that 25% of their school learners are involved in gang related
 crime, which resulted in the stabbing of an innocent learner. Given this, many schools are struggling to control proper discipline in classrooms because of a few bad behaved
 learners. Thus, I believe that adequate manners should be taught at home,
 so that it does not affect other learners at school. 

Despite this, schools have the responsibility to rehabilitate troubled students. For instance, The Department of Education introduced a new regime where schools should accommodate learners based on all their needs, and place them in a rehabilitating program if necessary. Hence, schools have a moral obligation to transform a 
learner
 for the better of society. However, even though it is compulsory for schools to always improve a learner’s behaviour, parents ought to instil this at home. 

In conclusion, there has been much debate on whether parents or schools are responsible for the behaviour of a child. In my opinion, the fundamental roots of good manners should be encouraged at home, where a student can rather inspire proper behaviour at school. Schools cannot be held responsible if bad behaviour is tolerated at home.

Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"#countries
#someone

#age
#development","Anti-discrimination against someone’s age is a common observation in many countries. Even more so, some countries are obligated to allow all ages to apply for open vacancies. In my opinion, while there are both advantages and disadvantages to allowing all ages to apply, the overall impact leans toward the negative. 

One paramount concern is that some occupations undoubtedly require a certain amount of years experience
 to fully comprehend the job requirements. For example, Marine Exploration in Iraq requires all applicants to be at least 35 years old, as the job is mentally draining. Moreover, occupations like pilots, surgeons or sergeants often require excessive life experience and failure to this
 could lead to depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Given this, it is evident that there are certain occupations who
 require an individual to obtain a sufficient amount of life experience, and legalizing all ages to apply might have a negative outcome. 

Despite this, one notable benefit is the unparallel
 convenience that it offers pensioners. For instance, Global Engineering has no retirement age as they believe some minds do not age and can still be beneficial to the company. However, the likelihood that an underaged child or pensioner can perform at the same performance level as a seasoned specialist in its prime is scarce. Thus, it is my contention that job vacancies should rather have an age restriction. 

In conclusion, allowing all ages to apply for a job can be beneficial for individuals who can do the tasks no matter their age. However, there are too many occupations that must have an age restriction due to mental maturity. If people of all ages are allowed to apply for jobs, then certain occupations might not be able to perform as they should.

Some argue that listening to news without visual pictures is the convenient way but others deny and prioritize  television news. This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion.

On the one hand, radio allows individuals to obtain news updates without disrupting their daily tasks, making it convenient for multitasking. For example, it has been proven by the United States in 2023, 60
% of people prefer listening to radio news as they not only complete their daily tasks while getting knowledge of all around the world but also maintain their health improvement by neglecting screen news. It is thus proved by the above illustration that radio has made its space sustainable during this modern period due to its abundance of benefits.

On the other hand, most of the masses opine that watching television news benefits  those who get confused without visual elements which assist them in comprehending better  knowledge about stories. If a person, for example, loses his baby due to
 some reasons
 then he can easily provide a baby's picture to those channels that broadcast news on television and everyone around the world can visualize that picture on screen which sometimes can help people to find the lost baby. It is clear from this given reason that television not only provides us with information but also shows us some visual activities.

After analyzing the above points, it is felt that radio is the best option to get knowledge without affecting our health and delaying daily tasks. It is hoped that the coming generation will help to sustain its place as it is nowadays.

 since the absence of a diverse range of veggies and fruits will have detrimental effects on several regions. Conversely, some individuals within the community may possess a surplus of resources. The following paragraphs will explain the drawbacks of the perspective and provide pertinent examples. 

Firstly, it is important to note that many regions throughout the globe exhibit distinct climatic conditions that might potentially disrupt agricultural growth. Certain strategies thrive in warm weather, while others thrive in cold weather. For instance, a coconut need
 a humid and warm atmosphere in order to thrive and endure. Consequently, regions with low temperatures would lack access to these items if they are not delivered, along with several other food items. since
 a result, the population will experience negative consequences since the body need
 essential vitamins derived from vegetables and fruits. 

Furthermore, several crops provide a substantial quantity of items that need fast consumption. Otherwise, they will get obsolete and become obsolete. For example, it is necessary to consume fruits such as strawberries, bananas, and apples during
 a period of one week after their ripening stage. If the communities only consume local food, they would be unable to get it quickly and a significant portion of it would be squandered. Hence, it is essential to distribute the produce to other regions, not only to mitigate wastage but also to facilitate the commerce of the whole harvest. 

In summary, I believe that food should not be only eaten by local residents, but rather supplied to other regions that need them
 in order to minimise waste and enhance enterprises' profitability. Furthermore, everybody around the globe would be granted universal access to all Vitamins.

#years","Today, the distance between people who live at the highest level of  society and people who live at the lowest level of  society has  increased.This essay will argue that most politicians put their attention and assets on rich people beside of increasing the rate of inflation. Also, this essay will suggest that to overcome these situations, providing some positions for poor people to invest their money and increasing our concern about domestic products are the main solutions.

On the one hand, these days most  people who have a position in government in a country only put their all effort into rich people. Furthermore, the inflation rate in the modern era is one of the crucial concerns for many countries. The vast majority of governments around the world need funding, so to reach this goal they give more attention and assets to rich people. Also,  a couple of years ago human beings  faced different catastrophic situations which had a negative effect on the world's economy as well as increased the inflation rate. For instance, the inflation rate between  2019 and 2020  rose to more than 20% because of Corona pandemic.

On the other hand, to overcome this situation providing some opportunities for mid-level or low-level of society to invest part of their wages in governmental projects ,and reducing the dependency to other nations could be the main solutions. If politicians can change their perspective and provide a situation where poor people can invest a small amount of money in it to reach a lot of benefits instead of only using  rich people's assets, it could help other levelslevel
 of society to reduce their gap from rich people. Also, if governments just focus on domestic products instead of importing other materials that can be produced in the country, they can create more job opportunities for people especially poor people. As a result, not only the inflation rate would resist  different situations but also a lot of employees can find a good job with a great wage. 

In conclusion, in the modern day the gap between two groups of people, rich and poor level, has  increased due to a lot of attention by governments to rich people and rising inflation globally. However,  providing a situation for the investment of poor people and decreasing the dependency on other nations are the main answers to this gap.

However, there are many reasons that people prefer to choose their self-work first, individuals work on their own they don't want to work under any other person. Second, the flexibility of time is available for self-employment a person can take leave on their wish and can go early home without any restriction. Third, people become more self-independent by earning more money and self-reliance. For example, A freelancer can earn a large amount of money by working on many projects and according to suitable working hours.

Moreover,  self-employment has some disadvantages along with these advantages such as bankruptcy and social problems. To start a business an individual has to take a loan from the bank and after some time due to many reasons consequences occur the business is not going well so all the money goes to waste and the person bankrupt. Also, after opening an own business social problems occur such as isolation from the family due to workload and the person may go into depression due to not proper work. For example, A person takes a 50 lakh loan from the bank and starts a TV business unluckily the business is not going well all the money goes to waste and he goes into depression.

To conclude, nowadays, individuals choose to work for their own rather than for any Association. I agree with the statement because of the plateau of work, self-reliance, and self-independence. Nevertheless, some cons like loss of money and social issues.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"#people

#focus","In the perpetual pursuit of personal fulfillment
 and societal progress, the dichotomy between present mindfulness and future planning emerges as a perennial point of contention. While some advocate for the primacy of living in the moment, arguing that excessive preoccupation with the future detracts from the richness of present experiences, others champion the necessity of strategic foresight and goal-setting to navigate the complexities of life effectively. In this discourse, I contend that both perspectives hold intrinsic value, and a harmonious integration of present focus and future planning is essential for holistic well-being and sustainable success.

On one hand, proponents of present-centered
 living emphasize the profound significance of cherishing each moment and embracing the inherent beauty of the present. Indeed, life unfolds in the immediacy of now, and the cultivation of mindfulness enables individuals to savor
 the richness of sensory experiences, cultivate authentic connections with others, and foster a deep sense of gratitude and contentment. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that incessant fixation on future goals and aspirations detracts from the spontaneity and joy inherent in the present moment, leading to a life lived in perpetual anticipation rather than genuine engagement.

Moreover, the practice of mindfulness has been empirically linked to numerous psychological and physiological benefits, including stress reduction, enhanced emotional resilience, and improved overall well-being. Research conducted by luminaries in the field of positive psychology, such as Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, underscores the transformative power of mindfulness practices in promoting mental clarity, emotional balance, and a profound sense of inner peace. Thus, proponents of present-focused living assert that the pursuit of fulfillment
 lies not in the ephemeral promises of the future but in the profound richness of the here and now.

Conversely, advocates of future planning argue that strategic foresight and goal-oriented behavior
 are indispensable for achieving long-term success and fulfillment
. Indeed, the ability to envision future possibilities, set clear objectives, and chart a course of action is integral to personal and professional growth. By cultivating a proactive mindset and making deliberate choices aligned with their aspirations, individuals can navigate uncertainty with confidence and resilience, ultimately realizing their full potential.

Furthermore, strategic planning enables individuals to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and cultivate a sense of direction and purpose in their lives. Whether in the realms of education, career advancement, or financial management, the benefits of prudent foresight and goal-setting are evident in facilitating progress and attainment of desired outcomes. As noted by management guru Peter Drucker, ""The best way to predict the future is to create it,"" underscoring the proactive agency inherent in shaping one's destiny through deliberate action and strategic planning.

In conclusion, the contention between present-focused living and future planning represents a false dichotomy, as both perspectives offer valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of human existence. While the practice of mindfulness enriches the quality of present experiences and fosters inner peace and contentment, strategic foresight and goal-oriented behavior
 are indispensable for realizing long-term aspirations and navigating the complexities of life effectively. Thus, rather than privileging one approach over the other, individuals are encouraged to cultivate a balanced synthesis of present mindfulness and future planning, harnessing the transformative power of both paradigms to foster holistic well-being and sustainable success.

#freedom","It is common
 belief that today children have so much freedom. However, I firmly believe that in some ways it is not a good idea, and they should not be allowed to have lots of it. I totally disagree that
 and, I will elaborate on my point of view in the following paragraphs.

To start with, kids should be watched in their behaviors
 because they are so young and they do not know the thing is right or wrong. Under parents' surveillance, kids may not make serious mistakes. For example, fathers or mothers should have to stand in the playground with their kids. If kids get injured, they can deal with it instantly. That is very important. If children have plenty of free time, that will be risky. Who knows what will they do in that period?

On top of that, kids usually do not have too much homework to do in the early grades in elementary schools. As a result, they have enough leisure time to do anything they want. Some of them do not go to learn instruments, sports, languages, and so on. They feel so bored all the time. Therefore, some gangsters think this is good for recruit
 them to do illegal stuff. For instance, when I was a primary school student, some of my classmates joined a criminal organization. They did some things bad, and several guys were caught by 
polices
. In the end, they were living in a jail.

In a nutshell, in order to keep your kids safe, it is vital to deprive some part of their freedom. Another reason is that if they have time they do not how to use it, they may be hired by someone and they could do terrible things. Thus, they should not have a long time for themself.

#disadvanatges","Today many people in some countries are facilitated
 to consume cheap goods by the government. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, both sides will be explored before evaluating whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.

Regarding the benefits, perhaps, it might be said that cheaper goods can be more accessible to many people. This can improve people's quality of life with basic and luxury goods, thus enabling more comfortable and pleasant living conditions. In addition, the availability of cheap goods can stimulate economic activity by increasing consumer spending, which contributes to economic growth. For example, the middle class is helped economically to fulfill
 their needs.

However, we should not ignore the various drawbacks that this phenomenon may bring about. First, over-reliance on cheap imported goods can lead to a country's dependence on foreign markets, posing risks to national security and economic autonomy. Second, low prices often lead to overconsumption, which can generate significant waste, contributing to environmental degradation. In this case, it is very detrimental to ecosystems and society. Finally, mass
 production of cheap goods is often associated with unethical labor
 practices, including exploitation and unsafe working conditions in some countries. For example, fast and cheap food brands often rely on cheap labor
 in developing countries, where workers, most of whom are women, are exposed to poor working conditions, long hours, low wages, and even forced labor
 in some cases. This exploitation perpetuates the cycle of poverty and inequality.

In summary, I am of the opinion that the lack of measurement of trends relating to cheap goods can be a substantial drawback. As such, it outweighs the potential benefits.

 from home. In this essay, I will discuss what are the advantages and disadvantages of this development. 

On one hand, one advantage could be the time saved. Firstly, all the time we usually spend travelling and getting ready,
 is not required while working from home. Another advantage would be the convenience of working from bed and also the advantage of multi-tasking, for example, it will be possible to work and cook at the same time. 

On the other hand, as I said above, working from home looks easier and comfortable, but is the same time could bring a lot of disadvantages in
 our lives. One of them could be social lack, no more meeting your colleagues, also just laying in  bed cold brings health issues such as obesity, or spine problems because of the comfortable position,  you are not travelling anymore, you do not get  fresh air in the morning you used to had
 while travelling and also the sunlight is very important, and again, you will not have that if you are not going out of your home and travel for work.  

To conclude, working from home has advantages and disadvantages and the best option I believe is to find the balance between those, working from home some days, and  others travelling for work, avoiding the social lack and all the health issues.

Whilst acknowledging that some parents say that studying their loved ones with peers of the same gender, some people prefer multi-gender schools as they provide different life skills than single-sex schools. I agree with the statement that children go to co-educational institutions because youths can gain various experiences and knowledge.

As education is an important integral part of preparing a future generation, parents and grandparents need to decide which type of schools (multi or single genders), they send their children to. The majority of them choose schools with mixed genders because children have an opportunity to interact with others. One of the advantages of participating in multi-sexual educational institutions is that they can deal with children who are in a different sexual category which is a fundamental quality of being a humankind. For example, knowing and observing the male’s attitudes and behaviours will help women overcome and manage challenges in their own family and their career, such as splitting the roles and responsibilities within the family. But also enhance personal development and interaction skills with diverse gender crowds.  

Moreover, another reason why I prefer co-educational places is that it sets the initial sense of human differentiation between females and males in terms of physical and mental perspective. As a result, children started to understand what females and males can and cannot do. For example, a woman cannot lift a heavy item because their body is not designed to perform such menial and hard work, instead, they have a reproduction ability and a better quality of caring and loving ones.

To conclude, today, there are many educational and learning centers
 to choose to send our children to, which target genders or special programs.

 development, some people believe that parents have the main role, while others think that being around good people, watching and following the right people will have a better impact on children in general. I really believe that both can influence your development equally, and following good advice and a good example from such an influencer on social media,
 will develop you as an amazing child.

On the other hand, I think that every child should have the freedom to follow and learn things from others, but at the same time, it needs to be checked by parents all the time. For some children, following people on television such as singers, actors, or businessmen,  seems to be easier for them, instead of following strict rules from their families. All these things can really influence any child's wishes to become reality
. 

On the other hand, I believe that parents have also a really important role in their children's development, only if they spend enough time with them and understand what their wishes are, which is also crucial. For example if you, as a parent notice that your child is attracted by medicine, it is your duty to make sure that at the right age, you will read books about medicine, or watch movies about that. 

To conclude, parents or friends, music or television, can have the same power to influence children's development equally, the important thing is to let them  choose by themself first, and just after that to decide if they are following the good thing for them or not.

#entry
#fee","Some individuals believe that there should be some charges for  entrance to museums, while others argue that there should be free access to museums without any fees. Although having free access to museums can encourage more visitors, I believe that institutions which charge fees provide them with a necessary and steady source of income, enabling them to maintain and improve their collections and facilities.

Having free access to museums can encourage more visitors. This is due to the fact that people who are from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds and underprivileged societies can visit there and in any other case they are unable to afford high entry charges. When there are no ticket prices, it encourages a lot of individuals to visit exhibitions as compared with the time of admission fees.For example, a national museum in Britain shows the arrival rate is higher during the time when there is no ticket price while tendency
 among visitors to make excursions during paid time periods is decreased. However, I believe that free museums can struggle with funding for maintenance, acquisitions, and quality exhibitions.

Charging fees by gallery
 provide
 them with a regular source of income which they can utilise towards furnishing of building and providing more facilities. This is because cultural and historical buildings require huge amounts of money to perform their functions without any obstructions. There are two sources of these funds one is donation and the other one is earnings. To manage these buildings successfully, alone donation did not serve the purpose, earnings from sources will be required as well and entry fees is
 the main source of earnings in the case of these institutions. For example, one research study shows that in order to run museums efficiently and effectively, they should have regular sources of money such as admission fees, on the contrary, donation is a non-recurring source. For this reason, I believe that buildings should charge entry fees which ensures their source of earnings.

In conclusion, although free access increases the number of visitors to museums, I believe that the collection of admission fees provides institutions with a significant source of income which further helps them to improve their facilities.

 including a lot of religious and non-religious events are disappearing day by day. In my opinion, this contributes to issues concerning cultural disintegration and should be intervened by citizens alongside with assistance of the government of a particular country. 

The main issues resulting from abandoning traditional festivals concern culture. More commercial holidays such as Christmas and Black Friday are gaining in popularity which naturally threatens smaller cultural groups and their festivals. For example, in China
 there are numerous ethnic groups living in remote areas that struggle to preserve their traditions over time as locals learn more about the outside world and leave their hometowns. As these groups disperse further, both results may impact the stories they hand down through generations, their language, traditional dishes and other aspects of culture. 

The optimal remedies
 for the weakening of traditional cultures are
 for governments and individuals to actively encourage traditional festivals. Governments can make the greatest difference. For instance, states could fund organizations that aim to promote traditional festivals by staging local events and reaching out to older members of the community. Younger people could likewise attempt to engage more with their roots and connect with the sources of their culture. This occurs to some extent already when traditional festivals are advertised on social media to bring in wider audiences and greater attention. 

In conclusion, the loss of folk events is a boon to globalization and injures the cultural identity of various groups. This development must be confronted by locals of
 their own individual initiative and encouraged by governments.

Firstly,  one of the main functions of the internet nowadays is the share of information over the world. 

For instance, people living in 2 different parts of the world are able to stay in touch with each other, which makes it easier to provide information regardless of geographical location. Furthermore, this kind of transmission can serve as tertiary education for some. 

Certainly, not only the benefits of the internet can be felt. With the growing popularity of the internet, unrestricted access to websites become easier. The non-governed sharing of information can be used by online predators to benefit from the innocence of children for their own purposes, which can dramatically impact children's psychology and end with trauma. Furthermore, children glued to their screens are lacking of socializing offline. Spending many hours by 
socializing online may lead to social isolation, which overwhelmingly affects the young. 

Alternately, individuals are in search of solutions for these problems. Engaging in more physical activities in the school curriculum may impact youngsters' digital addiction by making them more fit. Moreover, it may serve as a new hobby for young individuals by letting them choose what sport they want to do.

Firstly, online shopping is considered a time-saving option for many people, especially workers. To illustrate,instead of going shopping in stores after work and waiting in long lines for hours, they can shop online and obtain all their needs via click in a few minutes with faster delivery. For example, stuff from the supermarket and pharmacy, in addition to ordering foods during break hours, such as lunch,.
Secondly, easy access to the websites or applications of many local and international brands since they are available on different electronic devices such as mobile phones, iPads,and laptops; therefore, people can shop in worldwide countries in an easy way from their homes or offices. For example, OUNASS is a luxury shopping application that contains many international brands and provides fast delivery of shipments within two days to one week, a maximum. Additionally,some brands provide exclusive discounts for users shopping online. For example, Zara, a popular clothing brand, provides a ten percent
 discount for first-time online purchases. Moreover, customers can follow their favorite
 brand and be updated by receiving emails containing pictures of new collections and dates of seasonal offers.

, we have to solve this problem together. In this essay, I will attempt to identify causes and propose some effects that this matter brings about.

Broadly speaking, there are some main problems with this issue. Firstly, the major cause of this issue is that most children prefer high-calorie food such as hamburgers, pizzas, and something like frozen foods. These foods have spicy and salty tastes and it is easier to cook so that makes children eat instant foods frequently. Secondly, another reason is that most children have bad habits such as they lie after eating,
 and having irregular eating time.

In terms of proposing diverse effects to this apparent dilemma, the members of society, government, and researchers should cooperate together to reduce this problem. First of all, when bad habits are sustained, some children will have indigestion and some other health problems such as diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Secondly, obesity can cause depression because, if some people are dissatisfied with their body shapes, they don't go out and do not prefer to meet friends. As a result, that makes people always stay at home and reduce their self-confidence.

In conclusion, most people occasionally ignore doctors' recommendations for their happiness  overweight such as reducing eating high-calorie foods  and doing more exercise. Also when this behaviour and actions are sustained, this becomes more serious. However, efforts to protect their kid's health to 
solve this problem sensibly and easily.

It is argued that the surge in phone and computer use is leading to a decline the people’s abilities to communicate. In my opinion, the surge of modern technology devices cannot facilitate interpersonal communication.

On the one hand, the opponents consider that the ability of interpersonal communication loss is due to the following reasons. Firstly, the invention of Facetime can fully substitute the face-to-face conversations. Because of the improvement of technology, the technology devices enable people to distinguish subtle facial expressions. Moreover, emojis can convey emotions that are hard to express through texting. Messages do not always capture accurate feelings, therefore, the emergence of emojis can illustrate emotions vividly.

On the other hand, I believe that Face Time
 and emojis do not capture an individual’s feelings. First of all, FaceTime cannot convey complete human emotions. Hiding behind a screen means that only a fraction of body language is visible, which could lead to misunderstanding. Secondly, the use of emojis as substitutes for genuine feelings is limited. In many circumstances, people will use emojis to decline conflicts to be polite or avoid embarrassed
. Therefore, the emojis cannot convey a genuine feeling.

In conclusion, I believe that the surge in phone and computer use can weaken interpersonal communication skills, as neither Facetime nor emojis can comprehensively convey human emotions.

#student","While some people opine that male and female students should be accepted by universities in the same quantity in every subject, I would argue with this phenomenon due to my firm convince that the gender factor is not crucial. In this essay, I plan to spotlight my point of view and substantiate it with examples.

On the one hand, this idea carries with it a highly actual principle of gender equality and equivalent rights for all human beings. For example, I have seen a movie recently about times when it was strange and unusual for women to become  university law students. Obviously, if those times had not passed, women would still have to fight for the right to study where they want. Without a doubt, no one is loud against this idea.

On the other hand, there are faculties where the male
 students'
 number exceeds the female
 students' number, and this is natural for these specializations. For instance, the University of Sports and physical culture
 in my country has many subjects such as boxing, weightlifting and others where it is hard to find a woman student. In these subjects, it is impossible to maintain equality between students of different genders. If these institutes have to consider this parameter while maintaining competition among applicants, they will not be able to recruit the required number of students.

In conclusion, although it is vital to keep  gender equality among people studying in institutes, I still believe that the discussed above
 aspect should not be considered  the topmost one while maintaining competition among individuals applying for the subject.

ways have their own advantages. This essay will discuss both the methods and a conclusion at the end to support my view.

Firstly, school is an important place for all the children because they learn the basics of their education in school. School is considered as a starting line for the children. These days, schools offer many new activities and learnings that can be useful for children in many ways. For example, if we take a look at various schools, we can clearly see that they offer a nice and quiet environment for the children where they can learn new things at
 ease. Many children start to learn by observing other children along with them and that's why schools are the best place to offer academic learning. 

On the other side, there are many things which are not taught in schools. For example, basic human nature,  respecting elders, mother tongue and many other qualities which are taught by children's parents. School knowledge is limited upto
 academic and soft skills but the nurturing which is required for a child can only be experienced at home. There are many other learnings like rituals, and family procedures that are crucial for a child to learn at home.

In conclusion, I believe both school and home are equally important for a child's development. However, school is best for academic and soft skills learning while home is best for all other learning. This combination of both  places will work best throughout a child's learning journey.

#development","Nowadays, people in all corners of the country tend to migrate to big metropolis, resulting in a depletion of population in rural space
 and a high density of citizens in urban areas. While I acknowledge the benefits of this decision, it is a fundamentally negative development. 

Admittedly, the advantages of the trend of moving to the metropolitan area are indeed in plain sight. Chief of these is that the accessibility of a high living standard in 
center
 is far easier than in the countryside. This is true that people can participate in different types of infrastructures such as building complexes, hospitals and schools, which provides them multiple choices compared to that of rural areas. Additionally,this can be seen in the way rural populations seek a job or attend university and try their best to keep staying in big cities which allows them to have better opportunities and a bright future that their hometown is unable to provide them. 

Despite the benefits mentioned above, I believe that the large community departure to 
center
 is a negative development for various reasons. The major drawback is the imbalance of populations between urban and rural areas which means  high pressure will be placed on big
 place
 and the less people live in the countryside.This leads to  high traffic congestion and more apartments and roads have to be built to afford the high density of the population.Furthermore, this migration negatively affects the environment and human life because of the uncountable amount of toxic gasses released from vehicles and manufacturers. These factors are directly harmful to human lungs and the planet has to deal with the increase of global warming. 

In conclusion, although we should not ignore the positive impact of the increasing movement of rural populations to urban areas, this trend is contributing to the depletion of human health and pollution.

#happiness","In contemporary society, the debate over the significance of money in achieving happiness remains contentious. While some contend that financial wealth is essential for happiness, others argue that true happiness transcends material possessions. Both perspectives offer valuable insights into the complex relationship between money and happiness.

On one hand, proponents of the view that money is crucial for happiness emphasize the tangible benefits that financial wealth can provide. Individuals with ample financial resources are better equipped to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Moreover, they have the means to access luxuries and experiences that can enhance their quality of life, such as travel, entertainment, and leisure activities. Additionally, financial security affords individuals the freedom to pursue their passions and aspirations without the constraints of financial limitations. For instance, those with sufficient wealth may have the opportunity to pursue higher education, pursue career ambitions, or engage in philanthropic endeavors
 that bring fulfillment
 and joy.

Conversely, proponents of the opposing view argue that true happiness cannot be bought with money and stems from internal sources rather than external possessions. They contend that material wealth may provide temporary satisfaction but fails to address deeper emotional and psychological needs. Happiness, they argue, is rooted in factors such as meaningful relationships, personal growth, and a sense of purpose and fulfillment
. Moreover, the relentless pursuit of wealth can lead to a hedonic treadmill, where individuals constantly strive for more material possessions without experiencing lasting happiness. Instead, they suggest that cultivating gratitude, mindfulness, and contentment can lead to a more fulfilling and sustainable sense of happiness.

In conclusion, the debate over the role of money in achieving happiness reflects the complexity of human desires and aspirations. While financial wealth can undoubtedly contribute to happiness by providing security and opportunities for enjoyment, it is not the sole determinant of one's overall well-being. True happiness, it seems, lies in striking a balance between material wealth and internal fulfillment
, recognizing the importance of both external and internal sources of happiness.

#development","There has been quite an obvious discussion around the topic of purchasing goods. It seems to be that a lot of people decide to go shopping at a shopping mall rather than the local trading centre. I believe that it is a negative for development and i
 will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, there is no doubt that getting products from supermarkets can be more impressive, convenient and a good environment. This is because there is a variety types
 of goods can
 be corrected, which could be some import ones and also a buyer can buy everything they need just in one place. For example, younger persons in Thailand usually shop in malls where there is cooler air as they provide air-conditioners rather than markets that are open-air. As a result, a large number of owners of small shops have to shut down as they cannot face financial issues.

On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that correcting items from local communities would be enjoyable, relaxing and healthy. This is based on the fact that most of the products in local markets are grown or made by sellers which could be fresher and non-chemical than large supermarkets. For instance, people in Thailand not only go shopping in a regional shops
 just for some goods, but they also seek to have a chat with their neighbours. Consequently, the neighbourhood's friendship could be developed while they are shopping.

In my opinion, we can observe that if most people continuously shop in supermarket
, small shops which mostly
 owned by locals may have to be shut down as they cannot deal with financial problems.

#situation","It is said that children around the world are showing disrespectful behavior
 to older people. This phenomenon might stem from the habit of using smartphones during school hours. However, addressing more family activities can tackle the problem of disrespect.

In the first place, it must be considered that smartphones can have a negative impact on children's attitudes toward adults. Since smartphones are addictive, children may prefer spending more time using them than hanging out with adults. As a consequence, it leads to an extension of the gap between family members, which affects the way children behave toward adults. Take Gen Alpha as a contextual example. Due to the development of entertainment technologies, children spend the majority of their time surfing the internet so often that they start to show misbehaving actions toward elders.

Another cause that must be taken into account is the educational curriculum. It is obvious that children spend more time at school than at home, so they are more social with their friends. Over time, they develop their personalities and behaviors
 with their friends, thinking that the way they treat their friends is the same as that of adults. Because of that, the way they act toward adults might not be appropriate and be considered disrespectful. For instance, Vietnamese parents have to suffer a lot when it comes to their children's misbehavior
 due to learning from friends at school.

Despite the fact that it is a global issue, the problem of children disrespecting elders can be solved by organizing more family activities. It must be acknowledged that in order to teach children about their actions, parents can increase the value of family members through family work. By encouraging children to take part in activities, they will have some time away from smartphones, as well as increasing the value of the elders in the children's eyes. As a result, the gap between generations will be significantly smaller, and children will be more respectful toward older people.

In conclusion, smartphones and study hours are the roots of a lack of respect among children. Hence, organizing more family activities can enhance family relationships, which is the most effective solution to this worldwide issue.

The first and foremost reason for pros is that people can save money with the help of it because cars and other vehicles work with costly fuel. whereas, cycle work on free of cost. Moreover, in this hectic schedule, humans become obese which is a cause of diseases but if people use a cycle then they will become fit and fine. The third reason is that the roads are not full of traffic to use it. Hence, it becomes a boon for mankind free of cost. 

Nevertheless, there are some cons of it. As individuals do not have sufficient time to go to work because of busy schedules so they want to save time by using the fastest vehicle but they are not only late from work but also have to face weather conditions as sometimes the rain comes suddenly. Moreover, humankind is not safe on it. For instance, a man feels more comfortable in a car rather than on a bicycle so due to these obstacles, this is not best convenient for them.

 long
 and healthy life of people is considered a symbol of a successful society, some folks consider the elderly population a burden on the country.They may be right to some extent but dying
 of citizens at a younger age is not at all a positive indicator for any nation state
.

        Having a prolonged disease-free survival is a dream of every individual.Many countries have transformed this dream into reality by investing heavily on
 health
 sector.If a person knows that he has the potential of surviving
 to old age, he can plan his future accordingly.For example, my uncle who is fit at 
age
 of 70 years after having two jobs is now considering 
to spend
 time with grand children
.Moreover, increased
 number of healthy older residents in a society can contribute towards national
 cause.For instance, most retired persons remain on the reservist list in many armies and are called for active service during times of war.These disease-free persons can be helpful in many aspects like working as a part of think tank
, giving voluntary service for literary activities and making plans by sharing their own battle experience.

However, there is always another side of the coin. More
 the ailing population in a country, more
 the government will have to spend on them for welfare.As an example, in Pakistan, the employees after retirement get a lot of money as pension
 which is doubled at age
 of seventy five
 years and often the benefits are given to the families of the deceased.All these expenses are born
 by the government which put
 more pressure on the earning lot by applying greater tax.In addition, many of these sick individuals are dependent on family members for their physical needs.This means more members of a community are unavailable for active job
 as they are bound to look after debilitated patients.

                                      To summarize, getting an illness-free advanced age is a blessing for residents who may contribute to nation-building.Overall the merits of increased age outweigh few
 of its demerits.

I believe that it is derived from the robots' effective productivity and the lack of human resources in several jobs. Additionally, I argue that it will help ensure the safety of people in risky jobs, but it is also the major reason for the rising
 of unemployment.

It must be acknowledged that robots and artificial intelligence work more effectively than humans. To explain, while humans can only work from 8 to 10 hours per day, robots and AI work constantly for several days to meet the large requirement of products. For example, the Shoppee's shipping procedure is all made by automated machines instead of workers like before.

The lack of employees in some dangerous work is also raise considerably. In order words, the young generation now is not willing to work in dangerous conditions, they usually have trend
 to does office work which has a stable salary. It leads to a shortage of workers in risky jobs, so they have to utilise robots to do those jobs. For instance, currently, there is a repaired robot used to fix undersea cables which rare people want to do due to its high water pressure.

Furthermore, the replacement of robots in dangerous jobs can be ensuring
 the safety of people who do risky jobs. This is because, their still several things which only can be done by people so to keep safe, robots and artificial intelligence are used to support humans in dangerous situations. Take the job of digging underground tunnels as an example, people can be using
 robots to investigate the conditions of soil and oxygen before digging to ensure the safety of workers.

However, the enhancement of robots and AI in the workplace is also the major reason for the high-unemployed nowadays. Put into words, using robots and AI reduce the demand for staff because businesses only need a few machines' controllers. Such as Samsung which has been riding a large amount of workers last year because of the manpower surplus.

This writer believes that it is a beneficial development since cyborgs can work tirelessly and increase productivity.

The foundation of man-made intelligence and robots is that most companies in the world want their products to be more accurate and detailed due to their high costs. In other words, workers with a good geographic mindset are extremely critical in large enterprises, on the contrary
 it is quite difficult to find them out, consequently
 robots are an alternative method. In a variety of hospitals in Japan, 2000 nurse robots are being deployed to take care of aged people. Hence, more nurses can be promoted to be 
doctors in order to solve a number of emergency situations more quickly.

However, this writer thinks that the development of AI and automation is a beneficial advancement due to the fact of their efficiency. There is obviously no doubt that technology is becoming a vital tool in everybody's lives, as it can work for more than 12 hours a day without stopping or breaking. Moreover, robots can help improve the productivity of a company by automatically protecting the corporation's information. An illustration of this is the Ford Company, where most processes are done by robots with high accuracy and detail consequently they can produce more than 10 cars a day for each branch.

To conclude, the development of artificial intelligence and robots is supervising people in a plethora of fields of life, especially in the industrial zone. Hence, in the near future, robots and AI can be widely used as tools to solve more problems in people's lives.

light of the proliferation of technology, the role of humans in the workplace is being eclipsed by the enhancement of AI and robots. This author contends that this is an adverse development due to the modification of job opportunities leading to the minority  employment rate.

It must be acknowledged that the productivity of synthetic inventions outperformed humans In other words, with an initial investment, technological equipment can provide efficiency to complete tasks with no exhaustion and only require annual maintenance compared to a person who remains changed frequently. As a result, employers tend to replace their labour with autobots due to the accuracy and productivity they bring. For instance, Apple is currently operating their manufacturing system automatically with robotic engineering which a few observations of staff. 

Another argument worth considering is whether artificial intelligence and machines negatively affect  employment opportunities. It should be noticed that in this digital era, owners are utilising synthetic mechanics due to their convenience. Therefore, the majority of workers will be altered by automatons which means there will be a higher rate of unemployment. Consequently, people will be dependent on robots and give them most of the control.

 is now being replaced by automation. It is justifiable due to the superior ring of humans in numerous facets such as correction and optimum. Thus, it could provide infinite advantages to enterprises which leads to the improvement of society.

As the applications of robotics engineering pervade every aspect of life, it is hard to imagine mankind moving without it. As an explanation, robots are key to solving tedious daily tasks and free up time for other processes that are more vital. Taking the production industry as a prime example, in lieu of manually using labor
 to transport materials to the latter steps, it now can employ artificial intelligence in order to enhance speed. Aside from that, it provides a solution for avoiding human errors.

Notwithstanding the concern about robots, the upsides are defined. The foremost benefit is driving economic productivity. In other words, automated machines and procedures have dispensed with inconsistent and exhaustible physical toil and ushered in an era of unprecedented output and precision in manufacturing — a fear that can merely be perpetuated with the advancement of robotics technologies. It can translate into significant time-saving with the same amount of outcomes, resulting in more affordable prices due to mitigating numerous expenses such as space and administrative staff, among others.

In conclusion, eschewing labor
 in favor
 of automatic technologies is reasonable due to the substantial benefits offered to businesses. Hence, I would opine that the advantages that accrue from having these amenities are far weightier.

On the one hand, it is clear that the elders should be significantly supported by the government because they have many health issues and it is difficult for them to find jobs. Moreover, those spent their youth serving
 their own countries. Therefore, the government should pay more money to take care of senior people. Not only does this action motivate young people to dedicate to
 their countries, but it also helps to attract a quality workforce worldwide . To illustrate, many talented junior crowds in Vietnam have immigrated to America, Canada and other countries where they have good policies for elderly residents. 

On the other hand, some communities argue that the government should invest more finance in the education of the young generation. Because  
education plays a very important role in creating an excellent workforce that brings  high productivity, contributing to the development of the economy and many other aspects of a nation. For instance, America is the wealthiest country because it can attract the most talented young people on over the world. Because of the above reasons, I believe that the government should invest money in supporting of older generation and educating of younger generation in a balanced way. 

In conclusion, in this essay, I would like people to understand that if the government allocate more money to support the elderly, it will help to attract more quality workforce and encourage them to have more commitment whereas if the government spend more finance on education of young people, it will create a good workforce and high effectiveness.

To a certain extent, I agree that it may be true in the case of some societies. However, I also believe that recreational utilises like shopping malls as also vital as locations mentioned above. I will clarify both viewpoints in the following article. 

 

On the one hand, the opinion of equipping parks and body centers
 for the community is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, they provide a vibrant space where residents escape from their hectic lifestyles and are swamped with work to relax about, such as going to the park for a picnic with a buddy or family at the weekend. Secondly, they also offer a suitable place with equipment to encourage citizens to do some physical exercise like aerobics or running. That helps to keep their bodies fit and elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are the best spots for people to socialize with their neighbors
 when they play sports or talk to the 
passers-by in the park. 

 

Apart from the benefits expressed above, I would like to point out the essentials of shopping malls in the city. The first merit of a shopping center
 is local dwellers can go shopping more conveniently. It would enable them to purchase things in town without a long itinerary and pay for shipping. That allows individuals to get things at affordable costs and transport them home with less effort. Another reason is that shopping can provide employment. Local people can find work in retail to enhance their income to maintain their lives. 

 

In conclusion, although public parks and sports facilities serve as a spot to provide exercise and social activities for citizens, I believe that shopping centers
 have an equally important role since these places open job opportunities and convenience for town residents.

#seas","Due to human activities, a great number of land and marine animals face extinction and this problem is worsening these days. There are some reasons why this phenomenon is occurring, and there are also some ways to tackle this issue.

To begin with, there are some factors which result in animal extinction. First and foremost, destroyed habitats of animals can be a reason. In order to develop and prosper, it is inevitable for countries to carry out deforestation and water pollution. These processes can eventually harm and destroy the habitats of wildlife. In addition, there are still many hunters who kill or hunt animal species. As they illegally kill or harm animals for sales
, the number of animals decreases and results in extinction
 of them. Furthermore, the increased amount of discarded chemicals into
 water and soil may cause animal extinction.

However, some solutions can be introduced to alleviate the issue. First of all, reforestation must be implemented. It is important to provide natural habitats for animals. People should plant more trees to form more forests for animals. Secondly, governments and authorities must create animal reserves to protect endangered animals. By having these facilities, animals can reproduce be
 protected in safe places. Lastly, strict regulations must be imposed for illegal hunting. Illegal hunters should identify harmful
 effects of their actions and should be punished heavily in order not to continue their wrong behaviour. 

In conclusion, although there are more animals which are being
 extinct, I firmly believe that there are some ways to protect them. Thus, both individuals and governments should be aware of this problem and make some efforts to improve the current situation.

Besides, there are a few opinions that disagree with that statement because many people think that other problems are more serious. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss my opinion of both views.

As a person who lives in capital
 city, I feel the most destructive problem that my city has is the increasing amount of cars in the street every day. The traffic jams here in the city are very unfriendly. On average, we have to spend up to 2 hours just to travel 10 kilometres by private car or taxi. In addition, this unbelievable traffic occurs due to the lack of public transportation in the city. Consequently, the majority of people are taking their own vehicles to commute. Furthermore, all of these conditions lead to the
 raised level of pollution that will directly affect the lungs' health.

On the other hand, other problems are also aserious
 issues that still remain unsolved. For example, a bad schema of water irrigation in a city, so that there is a flood occurs around the city. Additionally, there is still a ghetto in an inappropriate surrounding that will spoil the city layout. However, solutions from the government in terms of these problems are
 not making
 the city better in recent times.

In conclusion, I believe that all cities in this world have their own problems that are different from one another. So, it is all about diverse views of people about their city's biggest problem.

#teachers","It is no doubt that technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in classrooms these days. There are some people say
 that technology should take over the place of teachers. I firmly disagree with this idea because the cost will be expensive and cannot meet the individual needs of learners. 

Replacing teachers completely in the classroom with technologies is not feasible for school management as it costs a significant amount of money. Schools usually have limited funding, and replacing all educators with advanced technologies requires new equipment such as tablets with interactive touch screens, electronic white boards
 and cameras which enable school operators to monitor students. In this case, operating a high-tech classroom would be more expensive than having educators on site
. Therefore, it would be impossible to replace educators.

On the other hand, taking over personnel with technology may lead to the individual needs of students being unmet. It is because the learning skills and capabilities of every single student are different, without proper guidance and supervision from experienced trainers, it would be difficult to design tailored study plans to meet individuals' needs. For example, learners who have been diagnosed with ADHD should not be taught the same as other peers in the classroom, a detailed teaching strategy should be implemented by teachers to accommodate the needs of these special learners whereas technologies cannot do.
 Hence, having all teachers replaced by technologies may oversee learners who have special study needs.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that teachers should be fully replaced by modern technologies because it
 cost over budget and usually do not meet the study needs of students who have special conditions.

To start with, pollution has risen into
 uncharted levels owing to the massive production of big companies, industries, or factories. Then, some laws have to be set up to establish control and change the resources that are used by them. For instance, McDonalds, Nestle, or Coca Cola
 must be under regulations in which they have to use renewable energies by fossil fuel, coal and gas combustion. Besides, deforestation and harvesting 
trees
 must be controlled owing to the fact that millions of kilometers
 of forests have been burnt, especially between Colombia and Brazil in a specific location called ""Amazonia"". 

On the other hand, individuals should be educated in order to be aware of environmental issues as well as ways to reduce the damage. For instance, in Colombia, there are many strategies for teaching about ecosystems and how to take care of them, either in schools
 children learn how to recycle and sort residues or some advertisements are around the city. Among those messages to be transmitted are the importance of taking shorter showers, using recycled paper and implementing techniques like solar energy.

 effect for
 people who live in this place, I would argue that large apartment buildings are more helpful for people’s lifestyles in this day. I will explain my reasons in this essay. 

There is no doubt that living in an apartment block can have a negative impact on people who prefer more living space. This is because some people would like to have more space for their families and outside areas for their lifestyles. For example, in Thailand, some families who have member
 more
 than 3 people prefer to have houses more than flats because they would like to have more space for their children. Also, some families have outside areas for their garden. As a result, an apartment block can not provide people do several activities.

However, it is worth pointing out that large apartment blocks and flats have many advantages for people’s lifestyles in this day. This is based on the fact that apartments are built close to the city centre and can be close to the residents’ work, shopping centre and transportation which can benefit for 
their lifestyles. For instance, Singapore has many apartment blocks for residents who would like to live near their workplace which can save them time. This is the reason why people prefer to live in flats more than a house. Consequently, apartment blocks can increase convenience for people who live in these facilities. 

In conclusion, we can observe that residents can be convenient while their
 living in large apartment buildings. Overall, I firmly believe that living in apartment buildings has more advantages than downsides.

Despite this, it is my contention that renewable energy and biofuels will take oil’s place, as these alternatives have proven to be more beneficial for the environment and local communities. The subsequent sections of this essay will explain this. 

Global warming and climate changes worldwide are largely caused by oil, however
 renewable energy has proven to contribute no harmful chemicals that can damage the environment. For example, David Attenborough conducted a study at National Geographic that indicated that fossil fuels are responsible for 89% of pollution, which causes a disturbance in biodiversity. In addition, renewable energy like solar and wind are also more cost effective
 and can safe
 governments money.  Given this, I firmly believe that renewable energy is a more suitable option, as it causes less greenhouse gas emissions.  

Biofuels are a modem invention that can completely erase the usage of oil. For example, a study at Green Agriculture found that biofuels have the potential to completely replace other energy sources, as they can be produced in almost all regions. Additionally, biofuels consist of various organic matter, which can financially benefit communities and farmers because they are not government owned
, like oil. Hence, in my opinion, biofuels have the potential to create more opportunities for humans, which allows them to live in a better economy. 

In conclusion, renewable energy and biofuels have the potential to replace oil in the foreseeable future, as I believe they are better for the environment and can benefit local economies. The entire world will benefit if alternative sources are implicated.

While some argue that too much emphasis is placed on safeguarding wildlife, I recognise the validity of this viewpoint, due to the pressing issues of poverty, lack of clean water, food scarcity, and inadequate healthcare and education in many parts of the world. However, prioritising funding for these necessities should not come at the expense of wildlife conservation efforts.

Admittedly, proponents of prioritising human-centric issues argue that directing excessive attention and resources towards animal and bird conservation might divert crucial funding away from other pressing human needs. For example, in many regions plagued by poverty and deprivation, basic necessities such as access to clean water, sufficient food, and adequate healthcare and education remain elusive for millions. Redirecting such a vast amount of resources towards addressing these fundamental human rights would potentially alleviate human suffering and improve the overall well-being of communities.

Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that safeguarding the natural world is an inherent responsibility of humanity. This is because human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and illegal hunting, have significantly depleted both the quality and quantity of the world's wildlife. The rapid decline of various animal and bird species is not merely hypothetical; t
 is a stark reality that cannot be ignored. Therefore, protecting these species is not only a matter of moral obligation but is also crucial for the sustainability of ecosystems and the survival of future generations.

In summarising up
, while I agree that addressing human-centric issues should be a priority, I also recognise the importance of wildlife conservation. Thus, balancing resources and attention between human welfare and environmental protection is crucial for achieving sustainable development and ensuring the well-being of both present and future generations.

I have found some data on this issue – the results of the opinion polls. The data is presented in the table.

     Overall, the data clearly shows that most travellers (38%) choose the seaside as their holiday destination. 27% of the respondents prefer to travel to the mountains. Interestingly, only 8% of the participants of the polls choose the capital city as a holiday destination.  

     If we look at the details more closely, we will see that the number of the 
respondents who travel to the seaside is twice as big as the percentage of those who travel to the cultural centres. Such a difference may be due to the fact that a lot of people prefer to relax on the beach rather than be culturally enriched. 

     While analyzing the data, it is possible to see some problems connected with traveling
 around Zetland. The fact that travellers in Zetland mostly choose the seaside as a holiday destination may cause environmental pollution. Overcrowding on beaches can cause pollution of the ocean and shorelines, which can have disastrous effects on the ecology. A good solution to this problem is to keep the pollution in check and provide the beaches with an ecology team.

#employment","These days, the old population who need occupation have to conflict with the young ones. I think this difficulty causes a number of problems such as economic issues, and to solve these government action is essential.

To begin with, jobs are important for people, especially elder citizens because they have families to care for and also some spend the same on study fees and loan charges  to tackle these issues they need a position to work in. Although, it is becoming a challenging duty because they have to compete with younger employees. Moreover, young
 are fresher and they have more power also they can learn more easily compared to old
 ones. As a result, aged adults have to reduce their expectancies and apply for lower positions so they will not do their main major. Consequently, they will earn less  struggle with hardships and have to work more hours to respond to their basic needs.

 

To tackle these problems, authorities have to introduce roles to support that generation such as free insurance or stable monthly payments that can cover all basic needs. For example, in some developed countries when a person reaches his/her middle age they can have access to various types of functions that are provided by governments such as scholarships for their children , and free healthcare so these people will compete less and enjoy more  life.

In conclusion, nowadays getting a job is a challenging matter for the aged population and they have to deal with economic issues. However, I think this could be tackled by acts of governments by introducing some roles to cover their needs.

The sun is known for its extremely hot and scorching heat. The journey to the sun would take quadruple the distance to the moon. According to that, I would prefer to visit the moon to search for the future habitat of human beings and to experience the no

Since the world is facing a global warming crisis  nobody knows when it is going to end. There is no doubt to search for the substitution planet to live on. If the resources of essential needs such as air and water can be discovered on it, Inhabiting  the moon would not be an unbelievable idea.

From my perspective, selecting a scientific discipline as a major necessitates long-term goals and meticulous planning. One major deterrent is the extended duration required to complete these studies, which may result in a lack of sustained financial and emotional support from families. Moreover, the inherent difficulty of science subjects poses a substantial challenge for many students, potentially leading to unsuccessful
 completion of their degrees. Science unequivocally demands a lively and creative intellect, causing some individuals to abandon their pursuit of it. Additionally, even after graduation, students who majored in science may struggle to find employment due to their lack of experience. This is because certain scientific roles prefer candidates with more practical experience, suggesting that young graduates might not be immediately suitable for science-related jobs.

This trend also has profound implications for society. On an individual level, it could exacerbate competition in other academic disciplines, such as business and management, thereby increasing academic pressure and creating a vicious cycle. On a societal level, the declining interest in science subjects diminishes their perceived importance, which is crucial for the development of society, including advancements in technology and space exploration. This decline could hinder the progress of societal technology.

In conclusion, the decision to study science at the university level is fraught with challenges, including the rigorous academic requirements and the need for a long-term commitment. These challenges contribute to the insufficient number of students pursuing science, which could have lasting negative effects on both individual career prospects and the 
broader societal advancement.

 circumstances and actively seeking to improve them reflects contrasting perspectives on resilience and personal agency. While some advocate for stoically enduring adversity, others argue for proactive measures to enhance one's situation. In this essay, I will explore both viewpoints and offer my opinion on this matter.

On one hand, proponents of acceptance argue that there are situations in life that are beyond our control, and attempting to change them may only lead to frustration and disappointment. Accepting a less-than-ideal job or financial constraints can foster a sense of contentment and gratitude for what one has, rather than constantly striving for more. Moreover, accepting adversity can cultivate resilience and inner strength, as individuals learn to adapt and find fulfillment despite challenging circumstances.

On the other hand, advocates for improvement contend that complacency in the face of adversity stifles personal growth and perpetuates inequality and injustice. Striving for improvement enables individuals to challenge the status quo, break free from cycles of poverty or dissatisfaction, and pursue opportunities for self-fulfillment
 and success. Moreover, by actively seeking to improve their situations, individuals can contribute to positive societal change and create a better future for themselves and others.

In my opinion, while acceptance has its merits in fostering resilience and inner peace, it should not preclude efforts to improve one's circumstances. While there are situations beyond our control, there are also many aspects of our lives that we have the power to change through determination, perseverance, and resourcefulness. By adopting a mindset of acceptance while simultaneously striving for improvement, individuals can strike a balance between contentment and ambition, finding fulfillment
 in both the present moment and future aspirations.

In conclusion, the debate between accepting adverse circumstances and seeking improvement reflects fundamental questions about human nature and agency. While acceptance can promote resilience and inner peace, striving for improvement empowers individuals to challenge the status quo and create positive change in their lives and society. Ultimately, embracing both acceptance and improvement can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling approach to navigating life's challenges.

#books","The rise of e-books in recent years has sparked a contentious debate about the future of the publishing industry. While some argue that e-books will eventually replace traditional printed books, others contend that printed books will always hold a cherished place in society. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide my opinion on this matter.

Proponents of e-books argue that digital technology offers numerous advantages over printed books. Firstly, e-books are convenient and portable, allowing readers to carry an entire library in a single device. With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and e-readers, readers can access their favorite
 books anytime, anywhere, without the need for physical storage space. Additionally, e-books often provide features such as adjustable font sizes, search functionality, and hyperlinks, enhancing the reading experience and accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.

Furthermore, e-books are environmentally friendly, as they eliminate the need for paper production and transportation, thereby reducing carbon emissions and deforestation. From a cost perspective, e-books are often more affordable than their printed counterparts, making reading more accessible to a wider audience.

However, advocates for printed books argue that they offer unique sensory experiences and emotional connections that e-books cannot replicate. The tactile sensation of turning pages, the smell of ink on paper, and the aesthetic pleasure of a beautifully bound book contribute to the overall reading experience. Moreover, printed books evoke nostalgia and cultural significance, serving as tangible artifacts
 of human history and creativity.

In my opinion, while e-books offer undeniable convenience and environmental benefits, printed books will never be entirely replaced. The tactile and emotional aspects of reading from a physical book hold enduring appeal for many readers, myself included. Rather than viewing e-books and printed books as competitors, I believe they can coexist harmoniously, each serving different preferences and purposes in the diverse landscape of literature.

In conclusion, the debate over the future of books underscores the dynamic interplay between technology and tradition. While e-books offer undeniable advantages in terms of convenience and accessibility, printed books continue to hold a special place in the hearts of readers worldwide. Ultimately, the choice between e-books and printed books boils down to personal preference, and both formats contribute to the rich tapestry of human storytelling and knowledge dissemination.

#support","In today's digital age, the debate between the merits of reading and watching television persists. While some argue that both mediums offer avenues for entertainment and learning, I contend that reading significantly surpasses television in enhancing language skills and nurturing creativity. This essay will delineate the manifold reasons supporting this viewpoint.

First and foremost, reading fosters a deeper engagement with language compared to watching television. When individuals read, they actively decode words, sentences, and paragraphs, thereby reinforcing their comprehension and language acquisition skills. Unlike television, which often provides passive entertainment, reading necessitates mental effort and critical thinking. For instance, readers must infer meanings from context, analyze character motivations, and visualize settings, all of which contribute to linguistic proficiency. Research by cognitive psychologists such as Keith Rayner supports this assertion, demonstrating that reading facilitates vocabulary expansion and syntactic development more effectively than passive activities like television viewing.

Moreover, reading offers a boundless landscape for imagination and creativity to flourish. Through literature, individuals encounter diverse perspectives, cultures, and scenarios that stimulate their cognitive faculties. Unlike the visual constraints of television, where narratives are presented in a predefined manner, reading encourages readers to co-create worlds within their minds. This imaginative process not only enriches one's inner life but also nurtures creativity by encouraging divergent thinking and problem-solving skills. Studies conducted by scholars like Dr.
 Keith Oatley elucidate how fiction reading correlates with heightened empathy and creativity, underscoring the profound impact of literary engagement on cognitive development.

Furthermore, reading cultivates a nuanced understanding of language nuances and literary devices, which are essential for effective communication and expression. By immersing oneself in a variety of genres and styles, readers absorb linguistic patterns, rhetorical techniques, and narrative structures that enrich their own writing and communication skills. In contrast, television, with its reliance on visual and auditory stimuli, often neglects the intricacies of language and relies more on spectacle than substance. As a result, individuals who prioritize reading over television are better equipped to articulate their thoughts, convey complex ideas, and engage in meaningful discourse.

In conclusion, the assertion that reading enhances language skills and creativity while television does little for these abilities is firmly supported by empirical evidence and logical reasoning. Reading not only deepens linguistic proficiency but also stimulates imagination, fosters creativity, and hones communication skills. As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the enduring value of reading as a catalyst for personal growth and intellectual development cannot be overstated. Therefore, individuals seeking to enhance their language skills and creativity would be wise to prioritize reading as an indispensable tool for self-improvement and enrichment.

#water","The issue of fresh water is growing rapidly around the globe for the time being. From my perspective, the most contributing factors to this problem are the pollution of water along with wasting clean water to fruitless things and banning throwing  rubbish into the water sources together with saving pure water can be considered as viable solutions to it. 

       Chief among the causes of this problem is contamination of H2O. For instance, If individuals throw trash into lakes , they will not be able to drink soft water. Accordingly, people are throwing a large amounts  
of garbage into rivers, Which can be harmful to the environment. Another important reason for this  is the usage of water for useless activities such as running the aqua for a long time. The prime example of this, some youngsters just open the tap for no reason. 

     In order to resolve this issue I deem that its root causes should be first addressed. Perhaps the most effective method of doing this would be, not allowing humans to throw the rubbish to banned areas. In this case, the government should give severe punishments to law offenders, however this shall ease the situation. One further measure can be preserving the water. As an example, If people save water there will be enough water for every person.

     By way of conclusion, I reckon that fresh water is  clearly a problem of such complexity that no solution is likely in the short term. Nonetheless, I believe that restricting   garbage to specific zones and the economy of uncontaminated water would constitute a very good first step.

Music can bridge cultural and generational divides as it allows people to perceive  emotions across diverse backgrounds. To be specific, the patterns in melody and rhythms can activate certain areas in people’s brains, leading to feelings of happiness or excitement in response to music. For instance, Gangnam Style - a fast-paced piece of music - was popular worldwide because when people heard the song, they spontaneously danced to it and enjoyed the moment together. Besides, some people shared their dance of the song on social media apps, such as YouTube, leading to heated discussions between individuals from different countries. Had it not been for music, people would not have such a good chance to communicate.

However, there are generation gaps in music as some elderly people find it difficult to appreciate the cutting-edge music genres. For example, some older people prefer the kind of music they heard when they were young and dislike the new forms of expression like K-pop music which is keen by the younger generation. In my opinion, different tastes in music are inevitable and these gaps encourage the younger generation to share their own ideas with the elders, which contributes to more communication between different generations.

In conclusion, while there are still some people who cannot accept music from the newest genres,I believe music is agood
 way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together.

 is generally believed that cities often have better living standards than countryside
; however, the trend itself creates issues. This essay will discuss the causes of it and provide possible solutions.

The disparity in living standards between cities and the countryside can be attributed to factors such as differences in public infrastructure and job opportunities. Rural areas often lack essential facilities like hospitals, schools, and supermarkets. Additionally, the limited job opportunities in the countryside results
 in the migration of young people to cities, leaving the elderly population behind. This creates a vicious cycle of dependency on the elderly population for support, as well as making cities overcrowded.

Improving the availability and accessibility of transportation is essential in reducing the gap in living standards between urban and rural areas. When transportation is convenient for individuals and businesses, the disparity in living standards is likely to diminish. For business, the cost of operating a business in the countryside is typically lower than in urban areas. Additionally, owing to efficiency
 of transportation, there is no need to afraid of losing connection to the city. At the same time, improving access to transportation increases the likelihood of individuals choosing to reside in cheaper countryside areas due to easier access to the city. With adequate transportation options, the decision between city and countryside living may not be a significant concern, thus helping to alleviate the issue.

In conclusion, the variation in living standards between cities and the countryside is largely due to differences in infrastructure and job opportunities, improvements in transportation by the government could lead to a progressive reduction in the gap.

 vacation a year for employees will negatively impact their work quality, I would argue that this is crucial for workers and gives them a chance to take a rest and become full of energy and enthusiasm in further activities. In this essay, I plan to highlight my point of view and substantiate it with examples.

On the one side, a long vacation is not convenient for employers due to the financial burden on the company budget. Obviously, this becomes more significant if the company has a huge number of employees. Additionally, a long interruption in the employment process is not the best thing that could happen as staff members feel a kind of strain the first time right after vacation until they will
 completely be 
involved in the labour routine. For example, it happened to me when after the New Year holiday I had a sense of confusion and even forgot tasks that were my everyday responsibilities.

On the other side, if a person works continuously without a break, he could feel depressed and tired. I am convinced that for a complete recharging a month's break is the best duration. To elaborate, if a week is given as a leave, an individual will be forced to do everything in a hurry, and I am not sure it is a true way to relax. Moreover, if a person feels sick, he will spend a whole vacation at home getting better. For instance, last year I experienced such a situation when I had a fever, and this was a reason for me to realize that a week is too short for taking a rest.

In conclusion, taking into consideration all the abovementioned, I would like to sum up that although there is an opinion that a month is a quite long period for leaving a workplace, I still believe that a shorter time period does not always match to employee's expectations.

Moreover, these kinds of people are more likely to feel guilty and ungrateful for missing their homeland and forgetting about the
 present life. 

The second situation is related to “migrants by a force” who didn’t have enough time to visualize their foreign life, but they were imagining one thing — surviving. Therefore, they have the highest stress levels, since they are less likely to know the language, culture, or other factors and conditions by which local citizens live. Furthermore, migrants might not have any financial stability and support due to losing their jobs and not being able to be hired. Eventually, these people need to take care not only for themselves but also their dearests
, and lack of basic resources might be detrimental.

To conclude, although migration can significantly benefit individuals in some ways, in most cases it is not an immediate and easy solution for the majority of people.

Some people believe that the products should be sold less packaged by the manufacturers and shopping malls. According to this statement, it is indisputably true because it will be one of the control methods to minimize many kinds of packing if the factories and suppliers manage it. To cite an instance, many researchers are pointing out that a lot of wastes such as plastic, paper and other materials concerning with 
covering products are 
come out by the primary level of production and selling process. Moreover, the shopping centres and producers are spending more on packing as decoration and they intend to attract the eye sights of shoppers and buyers. Therefore, it included unnecessary coverages that lead to an impact on the environment.

On the other hand, some convinced
 that people should acquire fewer packaged products is their responsibility. Consumers should be more prioritised on the quality of goods than packing. Furthermore, reducing needless packaging on each one and using recycled is the best way to take responsibility by individual to protect our environment. It is clearly seen that a way of decreasing in packaged.

After thoroughly delving into the subject, I have come to the conclusion that less packing in selling or buying products is a duty for not only the public but also the government. In my perspective, each person should take care of it and the government also set a strict regulation for ecology.

For this reason, many people believe that living in an urban area is more convenient for reaching academic and professional goals, while many others still argue the importance of developing skills by raising their children in rural areas. In this essay, I am explaining why each of them has either advantages or drawbacks related to upbringing.  

To start with, it is well-known that urban life has more appropriate conditions for studying, not only about basic infrastructural requirements but also about technological tools and educators with high-teaching
 skills. For example, in Colombia, there are many schools with luxury installations such as classrooms with cutting-edge computers and tablets in order to improve the quality of learning. Besides, tutors must certify at least one postgraduate degree in education and pedagogy. However, metropolitans have higher
 rate of competitiveness and stressful life, then these could be some triggers of mental issues such as anxiety or depression with an increase in suicide data. 

On the other hand, countryside life is more peaceful and its environments have less pollution. Then, standard skills about crops and harvesting could be taught by parents by inculcating an inherited pattern from generation to generation because families want their landscapes to be cared for by their offsprings
.  Nonetheless, rural areas have been uncovered by some governments, then they do not guarantee a high quality of education among those. For example, in Latin America, most populations that live on the outskirts have to walk for more than one hour to school.

To sum up, either cities or countryside have merit and demerit to live in. Hence, parents should consider all points of view thoroughly, and try to teach their children both types of lifestyles in order to open their minds and cultures.

#policy","Wearing a dress, which is selected by a school, has become a common practice. This essay will discuss both the Positives and drawbacks of compulsory rules for wearing uniforms. In my opinion, advantages
 are more than the disadvantages.

On the one hand, a uniform is an Identity for both the school and the students. It helps to create bonding between all the students. Consequently, this leads to brotherhood among students from different classes. Moreover, uniforms are essential because of their power to break  social classifications. For example, uniforms can ensure the same dress for the children from both the rich and poor students. This is a part of a lesson that can be useful for the students in their future life also. Finally, it is pleasant to see the beauty of a school, when all the students wear the same dress.

On the other hand, there exist some drawbacks, Firstly, students may lose their comfort because of wearing the same dress every day. Sometimes schools select such a type of dress, which is designed with many add-on parts especially
 on the Shoulder, such kind of dress is not at all easy to wear for a teenager. Secondly,  school uniforms may become a burden for parents. For instance, most  ofthe
 school provides Uniforms from their own store or shop and the price is always higher than outside. This tends to spend extra money for the Parents.

To conclude, although imposing uniforms has some drawbacks  likeuncomfortable
 and additional expense. However, I believe that the positive sides are more such as declassification in Society and identical representation.

#plastic
#containers
#food
#drink
#companies","Nowadays, plastic containers are widely used by food and drink companies all around the world. I personally believe that the negative points of using plastic are more than the advantages of that.

To begin with, certainly one of the advantages of using plastic containers might be the expenses of them. Simply put, plastics and the process of producing them are often cheaper than other products. For instance, some food and drink companies have mentioned that while the utilization of plastic containers might pose significant costs, in comparison to other materials, it is often a more cost-effective option. Moreover, another factor which is considerable is the weight of the plastic containers. Plastics are usually lighter than other materials like glasses, so companies find it easier to transport their products. 

On the other hand, the drawbacks of the increases in usage of plastics are by no means negligible, the prime concern is the difficult process of recycling plastics. Although,
 various types of plastics are recyclable , the procedure Is often expensive and not available for all kinds of them. A good illustration might be that due to those problems, recycling companies would rather  manage waste disposal instead of recycling them. In addition, another issue that might occur is  health concerns because of the danger of chemical release. Some certain chemicals are present in plastic. If the food or drink are
 exposed to heat, it might lead to food or drink poison. 

To sum up, I take the view that the downsides of using plastics are more than its
 upsides, due to the recycling difficulties and some potential health problems.

Besides, some people suppose that students should pay attention  more to their main subjects to gain a university certificate. In my perspective, I strongly agree with both statements because two ways can lead the students to a positive result.

For the people who want to learn more subjects in their program. The most reasonable reason is that they have a consistent basement in their main major. For that reason, learning and signing more subjects can help college students obtain new knowledge and bring new experiences for them in their learning process. Moreover, studying more subjects also helps pupils develop themself and makes them more confident to encounter  new challenges in the future. In addition, It also supports and brings  students more and more opportunities jobs for  after graduation. For example, students after university can easily apply for reputation companies if they have more qualifications in their time of college.

For students who believe that is essential to focus and spend all time in one major. That is also a good way to grow  with a strong foundation of knowledge. For example, paying  attention to their main subjects can help them separate their time from other activities such as sports, research and entertainment more effectively. Sometimes, having a busy schedule with many subjects is not a productive way to obtain new things and gain experience. In addition, most well-known companies and corporations such as Apple, Google or Riot require a huge amount of employees who have  wide expertise for their main in university. Because the percentage of finding jobs increases day by day and there are fewer  positions for employees than before. So, having a perfect qualification in one major can also be a potential priority for the young generation in their career occupation in the future. 

In conclusion, learning more subjects with the main major or concentrating more on the main subjects are both  reasonable ways to gain  success in the academic path. However, college students should find out their strengths and weaknesses to choose and categorize the most effective way for them.

I firmly believe that wildlife should be protected,regardless,of time as it is helpful in maintaining ecosystems  and insect populations.There are a multitude of factors through which it can be done which I will discuss in my further essay.

To begin with, wildlife plays an imperative role in maintaining ecological balance, pollination of crops and preventing the spread of diseases. If wildlife extinction continues, humans may face an ecological crisis. Therefore, there is a significant need to address this predicament and it can be achieved by a plethora of factors. The predominant one is habitat conservation. To elaborate further, conserving natural habitats, such as wetlands and woods, entails protecting land from development and human activities that can disturb the ecology. Subsequently,it can be done by reforestation, aforestation and wetland restoration. It not only helps in protecting the species but also aids in revitalising biodiversity. The nature-based projects provide their assistance in this gravest matter. For instance; Bulindi Chimpanzee Habitat Restoration Project. This project restores the rapidly declining chimpanzee habitat of over 300 chimpanzees in Uganda.

On the flip side, another worth mentioning method is to adopt sustainable land use practices. This can include promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing the use of pesticides and other obnoxious chemicals, and using eco-friendly technology in forestry and other industries. Besides this, it also involves reducing the impact of human activities,such as poaching and deforestation .In addition to this, public education and awareness also play a fundamental role in protecting.In order to educate the people about wildlife conservation outreach school programmes and public awareness campaigns ought to be organized.By generating awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation it may create a culture of responsible and sustainable behaviour.Along with this, through learning about different species and their unique characteristics, people can develop a great understanding of the natural world that will create a sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, despite having socioeconomic issues, wildlife preservation is mandatory because it contributes to maintaining the balance of life on earth
.Through various factors and methods,wildlife can be conserved.

Although it isn’t easy to measure someone’s value to society, I personally feel that scientists and technology experts have a more significant impact not only on our society’s economy,
 but also on essential services that improve our quality of life.

First of all, science, technology, and the arts are all very productive industries. However, while there is a shortage of scientists and technicians, there tend to be fewer jobs available for creative workers. As a result, creative people often spend more time unemployed, in temporary, low-skilled jobs, or working on eccentric projects that would need to generate more income. Consequently, they contribute less to society financially. An example of this is a study conducted in the United States which revealed that approximately 64% of individuals with a degree in the arts end up working in fields unrelated to their artistic expertise.

Secondly, although art and music are often greatly respected and appreciated, it is possible to survive without them. On the other hand, science and technology are necessary to provide power, water, medicine, communications, food and much more. Therefore, we could argue that experts in these fields are far more valuable. For instance, in times of crisis or natural disasters, it is scientific advancements that prove critical in saving lives and rebuilding communities.

In conclusion, I believe scientists and technology experts contribute significantly more to society than artists. They have more job opportunities and play a vital part in fields like healthcare, infrastructure, and innovation. While art and music hold great cultural value, the role of science and technology in providing essential services and improving lives makes them more valuable contributors to society overall.

 has become popular on some campuses and schools, leading to a debate between the benefits and drawbacks of this trend. While the effectiveness of distance and time can be appealing, there are significant concerns regarding their impact on students' mental states.

As for the benefits, it might be argued that with the increased time-effectiveness come the opportunities that online learning offers. In this world of technology, it is not surprising that many people choose online learning as an option. In addition, distance learning can save students's
 money in the form of transportation. For example, students who attend classes using the Zoom app and do not need to spend the effort to physically go to class save half the money.

First, it negatively impacts the quality of student learning due to the lack of face-to-face interaction and direct feedback from a teacher. Secondly, it can lead to a feeling of isolation and a lack of community as students miss out on the social aspect of campus life. Lastly, distance learning requires high self-motivation and discipline, which may be a challenge for some students. For example, in a viral video on TikTok during the rise of COVID and distance learning, a student who was in class just turned on the zoom and 
closed the camera and then did other activities without paying attention to the teacher.

In summary, I would argue that this lack of measurability of trends related to learning quality can be a substantial drawback. Thus, this outweighs its potential benefits.

In addition to this, not only don't I like this, but also that people are trying to ruin everything for the ""improvement"" of the city, they are supporting the view that making everything look more modern always makes people want to go there, but I would say that there is a big part of world's population who are fans of history that are deep into this topic, and they want to discover more and more cultures, countries, and cities with their incredible architecture. My hometown has its own expensive history, and the government could make more changes to develop the cultural segment of the city instead of giving everything to those huge businesses that are destroying everything that tourists like.

To sum up, I want those people who have control of the population and those beautiful facades of ancient cities to look at their actions more and rethink what they are doing because my whole heart and soul crave those buildings to be in their places, I see no advantages on rebuilding something that could give the gradual rise on tourists visits, that is saving our history and making city looks more picturesque.

With the impact of global pollution, the question of whether the government has effective measures to address this problem has become a matter of considerable debate. Some people and experts consider the government have
 been sluggish in implementing relevant political action. From my perspective, I agree with this opinion.

There are several reasons why policy initiatives to deal with climate change have been inadequate.

Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that consumer culture and overconsumption have led to a significant increase in carbon emissions and environmental degradation.Despite the growing awareness of the need for sustainable living, political leaders have failed to enact policies that promote responsible consumption patterns and discourage wasteful practices.

On the other hand, empirical studies have shown that pollution particularly from industrial activities continues to exacerbate the impacts of climate change.Even though numerous international agreements and initiatives aimed at reducing emissions and curbing pollution,progress has been slow due to political inertia and the influence of vested interests.Therefore, there is often a gap between public opinion and political action. 

In conclusion, while the recognition of climate change as a threat to the planet is widespread, political action to address the root causes of excessive consumerism and pollution remains inadequate. To effectively combat climate change, governments must demonstrate stronger leadership and commitment to implementing policies that promote sustainable development and reduce environmental degradation. Only through collective action and international cooperation can we hope to mitigate the impacts of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.

On one hand, social networking sites undeniably offer numerous advantages to individuals, fostering a broader sense of community. Firstly, they serve as a conduit for continuous updates on global affairs, including political developments and financial trends. Moreover, they facilitate maintaining familial connections and even fostering new relationships. Lastly, they serve as invaluable platforms for expanding one's knowledge and skills through the sharing of useful information and access to free educational resources, thereby enhancing career prospects.

However, the flip side of the coin reveals that social media platforms can harbor
 substantial detrimental consequences for both individuals and society at large. Firstly, the ubiquitous dissemination of information on these platforms often blurs the line between truth and falsehood, leading individuals to engage with
 misleading or fabricated content. Furthermore, the ease of connectivity can expose users to various risks, such as falling victim to scams or unwittingly engaging in illegal activities. Notably, the pervasive phenomenon of peer pressure among the younger demographic can be directly attributed to the influence of social media platforms. Alarmingly, recent reports indicate a significant surge in mental health issues among young people, with the prevalence more than doubling over the past decade.

With all of the aforementioned theses and explanations, the conclusion is self-evident. I believe that social networking sites can originally assist humans and society; however, they bring far more significant harm to both individuals and society

Some parents want to revive the dreams that they did not reach. All of us had unreached dreams during our educational periods. We pass those days, but those wishes remain in our brains, so when we face a similar situation again as parents, we try to do all we can to help our children get those wishes. The point is that we never think that our dreams and our children's dreams are the same. We don’t know our children’s talents, and because of these inconsistencies, we put our children under pressure. In some cases, parents are really opinionated, and they can’t learn from their opposing views. They just try to do anything that can make a better future for their children.

Parents play an important role in their children's lives. But these rules should give them a sense of sacrifice and companionship. First, students need to feel valuable without any judgment about their exam result
. Parents should prove to their children that their love and anything about school are
 two different things and can’t affect each other. Children should feel that the family is always by their side as a supporter and companion. The failures and shortcomings of the students should be understood by the family.

Childhood plays an important role in everyone's lifetime. and the way that parents face their children can cause different traumas in their minds that can harm their lives in the future. So, how to deal with children should be considered important, and families should be taught about it.

 for consumers. I will explain my reasons in this essay.

There is no doubt that most supermarkets provide all goods and well-designed layouts. This is because the most part of the goods are located in the appropriate department, which can make it convenient for customers to find a product. For example, in Australia, Coles supermarket can provide all goods such as dairy-free, gluten-free and nut-free in each department that can be easy to find from buyers. As a result, that can make all customers less spend time on their shopping while they have to go to work or have to look after their kids.

It is worth pointing out that mega-stores are necessary for buyers who would like to buy a greater number of products. This is based on the fact that shopping in a big supermarket that can also have 
offer a special price to buy all products. For instance, Costco Wholesale can provide the price of their goods with
 a decent price while their membership customers buy a large amount of products at that time. Consequently, many supermarkets offer special a discount system by encouraging people with membership cards.

In conclusion, we can observe that shopping in a big supermarket has a lot of benefits for consumers that
 can be a convenient location for goods and decent prices. Overall, I firmly believe that this trend is a positive development.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","#countries

#research","Being a homeowner has always been at the top of the list of a person's important life ambitions, especially in today's world where getting a place to live requires a lot of labour. Hence, the history of a home or an apartment is among the concerns that many people often tend to investigate. Hence, in this essay, I will provide several reasons why they do that with a number of methods that assist them in finding out the information.

On the one hand, when it comes to the purpose of this behaviour, it can be attributed to various reasons, and individuals can undertake research to uncover the ancient background of their houses or buildings. Having deeper insight into the state of the area you will shortly occupy could give you useful information for future renovations or replacements as well as give you more leverage in negotiations with the previous owner of the property. To paraphrase, those who intend to sell a house learn about the past of the property to appraise it. In fact, homes with significant historical value will cost more than typical ones.

Learning about the history of one's house or building may contribute to a sense of personal identity, as individuals uncover the stories and events associated with their homes, potentially linking them to their own family history and their ancestors. However, as for the people who are spiritual, knowing about the house's past is a means of warding off negative energies by worshipping, for example. Lastly, we just inherit curiosity—along with other survival traits—that have long been a part of our ancestors' lineage. In brief, people have a desire to find out about their home's origins for a variety of reasons, depending on the circumstances and goals.

On the other hand, with regard to the approach people choose to discover the information of their accommodation, it’s quite hard and difficult to filter the right ones. For starters, a throughout discussion with a real estate agent or a past owner of the property would be fair enough. If possible, one of the sources that we can easily take advantage of is word of mouth, or it may come from rumour
. In other words, to gain understanding, individuals frequently interact with locals who have lived in the region for a long time or with the elderly, but this is hard to verify. What’s more, another way is that they may use resources in local libraries and historical societies to explore documents, images, and detailed histories related to specific areas and properties. Last but not least, if the mentioned residence is a well-known place, the Internet is the best way to help the owner collect data. Last but not least, the local government's database contains everything you need to know about the details of the house as well.  Therefore, there are various methods that people can apply when they need to gain a comprehensive understanding of the history as well as the development of the property.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why the public is becoming more intrigued in discovering the historical significance of their home or structure, and they can conduct in-depth studies by utilizing a variety of archival, community, internet, and academic resources. Obviously, finding the right approaches is vital for us if we need to save time and money.

#jobs","The standard office schedule typically spans 8 hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., across 5 consecutive days, leading to widespread employee fatigue. To combat this, there's a proposal recommending that employers grant at least four weeks of annual leave to enhance workplace performance. This essay supports the proposal that offering at least four weeks of annual leave could significantly boost work outcomes.

 Humans differ from machines in their need for downtime; relentless annual labour diminishes our efficiency. This effect is especially pronounced in repetitive jobs, where the absence of breaks can degrade performance. Ample evidence has demonstrated that prolonged workdays, especially in roles that interact directly with customers or involve healthcare aggravates the ambient.  Employees may provide subpar service and even exhibit unpleasant facial expressions, failing to meet the visitors' expectations leading to tarnishing the company's reputation. Thus, breaks are essential for rejuvenation and energy replenishment. 

Imagining a scenario where staff work every single day without rest highlights the chaos and potential for adverse customer experiences. This realisation bolsters the argument for mandatory four-week vacations, allowing employees time for relaxation, personal pursuits, and a return to work with renewed enthusiasm. 

 Ultimately, given the considerable hours dedicated to work, ensuring employees have sufficient time off is critical for maintaining balance and preventing burnout. The entitlement to a month's holiday annually supports a healthy work-life balance and upholds the principle that well-rested employees are more productive and engaged, carrying a rewarding impact for both the company and the worker.

#skills","People have different views with regard to learning teamwork and strategy whether through observing sports or active participation in them. While watching sports may offer insights, I personally believe that actively engaging in sports is more beneficial for developing these skills. 

There are several reasons why watching sports can foster teamwork and strategy in individuals. Firstly, many people are passionate about sports, making it an accessible and effective means to acquire these skills. For example, football lovers can learn from their favorite
 team’s strategies and observe how well the players collaborate with their teammates to win the match. Secondly, by only observing team sports individuals can focus more deeply on achieving necessary teamwork and strategy skills as it is less stressful compared to actively playing sports for the purpose of winning. Finally, watching sports can offer valuable insights into strategy and teamwork. Individuals can analyze successful teams' tactics and observe player interactions, applying them to their own understanding of these features.

Despite the above arguments, it seems to me that playing sports can be a more practical rout
 to instill teamwork and strategy abilities in an individual. By participating in team sports, people can analyze and internalize these skills. For instance, in a basketball game, players must communicate effectively, coordinate their movements, and adapt their strategies based on the actions of their opponents.

In conclusion, for the reasons mentioned above, I believe that active participation in sports offers experiential learning, fostering a deeper understanding of teamwork and strategy compared to passive observation.

#trend","Funding sports is more and more common as a business tactic of numerous brands. While some individuals are skeptical
 about the abovementioned approach, this essay will highlight several reasons why the benefits outweigh the negative sides. 

On the one hand, sporting sponsorships certainly bring about some disadvantages. First, one of the most straightforward approaches for sponsoring is to advertise on sporting events' live broadcasts. However, brands might struggle subsequently due to the high cost of this marketing tool. For example, companies are shelling out roughly $7 million for 30 seconds of ad time on the Super Bowl. With that being said, not every brand receives high turnover from this practice, especially with controversial commercials that will spark public outrage. Secondly, brands that sponsor certain teams or prominent athletes can face backlash when scandals occur. Companies’ brand images will directly be affected which requires intensive and lengthy public relations management. 

On the other hand, this practice is still favored
 by most international brands for its merits. First, for some sporting events, sponsorships are crucial for the organizing and operating process. The Olympics is one of many events that receive funds from footwear brands like Nike to beverage brands, such as Coca
 Cola to assist athletes and efficiently develop more sports worldwide. Furthermore, sponsoring sporting events also means boosting brand awareness on a mass scale, reaching various age ranges and new potential customers. Eventually, this results in higher sales that in the long run, will compensate or even exceed the previous vast sum of money for advertisement.

To sum up, while sponsoring sports still has room for discussion, I am of the opinion that collaboration between sports and corporations could offer higher mutual benefits for each other, as one receives financial aid for operations and one earns reputational advantages and a rise in sales.

I believe that advertisement is the strongest method of marketing. While these promotional contents can be deleted if they are not appealing. This essay will discuss both sides, along with my viewpoint. 

Advertisement is the main tool that has persuaded us to buy something. This is because most people strongly believe something that they hear or watch visually. Therefore, advertisements are still being significant method to sell products or services, hence, types and methods of marketing are changing day by day according to  social development. For example, livestreaming is  popular  these days on social media and marketers often use it for their business on a daily basis. Consequently, there are many marketing tools, advertisement is the strongest one to persuade users. 

On the other hand, according to technological advancement, people are able to choose what they watch or do not. This advancement offers the choice whether
 to watch or see advertisements or not. For example, it is possible to ignore some unnecessary marketing content by clicking a simple button. Therefore, some people usually do not care about promotional content while watching TV or social media channels. The majority of people are only interested in promotional content if they feel useful . 

To conclude, in my opinion, advertisements are still  one of the useful methods of sales because of the fact that people are persuaded by them. Conversely, some advertisements can be ignored or stopped if they seem not useful for consumers.

On the one hand, some people justifiably argue that the people who are talented and can be useful for a country who suffer from financial problems, this opportunity to study in a good university is taken away from them. From an educational standpoint, all people  should benefit from equal conditions for academic studies and this opportunity can be given by holding an entrance exam. From a social perspective, if certain people only have this chance and go to university, it can cause a class gap in society.

On the other hand, another group of people claim that the salaries of the employees and the budget of the university should be provided through the tuition fees of the students. They insist that the government should not bear the cost of students' education. However, I do not find this argument convincing as students have no duty to fund universities. The government should invest in students and nurture them in order to use them in different positions in the future. Besides studying, students can participate in research and industrial projects of universities, which makes part of the budget of universities to be provided.

To conclude, In my view, It is not fare
 to study by paying money. All people in the world should be able to study. Moreover, the government should invest in student

On the one hand,based on much scientific research, the brain secretes some hormones responsible for feeling happiness. To illustrate, one of these hormones is called endorphins, which the brain secretes after exercise. In other words,people who have a healthy lifestyle and do regular exercise will feel happy every day. It is obvious that people are mainly responsible for choosing to have a good life and be happy.

On the other hand,others believe that happiness is always linked to several factors in life. For example, people who agree that happiness depends on money, such as the common concept that travel always brings happiness.

Both views have valid points; however, I firmly agree that everyone can control their feelings and opt to be happy or not, and that does not depend on any factors such as money or travel because it is temporary. Since many people might have a lot of money, they are not happy. Therefore,I believe that happiness is a choice because people should live a lifestyle that brings them joy.

To sum up,we could say that everyone has the freedom to choose temporary happiness by linking their happiness with stuff or to feel happy daily.

Robots and artificial intelligence now are familiar to society as they are strong and robust. Those machines was
 made from metal that is tough and strong ingredients can cope well with the high and tough working environments. Moreover, those machines can automatically generate actions based on a simple request, without any help. Consequently, robots are potential tools for some jobs requiring strength and tolerance skills to avoid job accidents in humans. For instance, robots are now used in construction sites where they are used to carry heavy packages or work at  high altitudes. 

Those robots have improved the public's status by preventing employees from suffering stress in the workplace. These devices not only  do heavy jobs but also check the mistakes in documents in offices. Using its search program, artificial intelligence applications are applied to office workers with new ideas or develop  plans for their products. In this way, workplace
 is not a stressful place, forcing employees to generate new ideas and also the products are completely perfect when publicizing them. Moreover, reducing stress also helps the public have a better experience in their mental health and their social life. Therefore, robotic achievements are the best tool for people, especially in this era when everyone can easily suffer from depression.

In conclusion, automatic automobiles and synthesis intelligence are replacing humans due to their superior ability that bring benefits to a country. Furthermore, this alternative may result in lower depression in people.

work of humans in big companies. It is the writer of this essay who contends that this is a negative influence in the near future due to the significant changes in the number of jobless people in all fields.

There are a variety of negative impacts when intelligent retrieval develops. Firstly, artificial intelligence will cause an increase in unemployment in the near future. This is particularly the case for manual workers who will be replaced by AI robots because robots can do manual jobs precisely in a short time, such as delivery men or cashiers in supermarkets. Secondly, people can leak private information because they use smart devices that are based on expert systems. This is because users have to sign up with their real information to use some platforms, and this makes hackers and cybercriminals able to steal personal information through the Internet. For example, according to some surveys, thirty percent
 of Facebook users in 2019 admitted that their accounts were stolen.

 

However, in my view, the development of the artificial intelligence field has greater positive impacts on people's lives. Primarily, artificial intelligence will help boost productivity in companies. In fact, officers can save much time solving paper work
. Moreover, people's lives will become more convenient and smarter with the Internet, which is based on knowledge engineering technology. For example, with a smart home system, people can turn on or turn off the light with their voice, and this system can even send an alarm from home to the owners.

In conclusion, although the growth of neutral
 networks has some negative impacts on human lives, I believe that the artificial intelligence field brings better effects on lives, such as working and quality of life.

 due to their efficiency. However, our society will face detrimental effects if humans depend too much on technological devices.                              

One of the core reasons why artificial intelligence become the norm in industries has to do with how it can help people make work easier in terms of time-saving. Due to the fact that machines can take care of the bulk of work, thus, giving individuals more time to complete more tasks. Take hospitals in Japan as a good example, where technology prepares prescriptions automatically so that the doctors will have enough time to get equipment ready for surgery. Therefore, the process will be made in a more productive way.

It should also be recognized that this tendency may lead to negative consequences in terms of work life. The proliferation of automation will make people easily lose their jobs as machinery can do the work of a person. In addition, with robots, many steps have been automated . As a result, the yields are boosted, which means there will be a downsizing in many factories because robots can gain an edge over humans . As a consequence, the rate of unemployment will increase significantly due to the development of technology.

In conclusion, high-tech devices play an important role in the work environment, which help
 to fulfil human duties. By contrast, industries which rely too much on that kind of machines
 will easily cause a decrease in labour
 force.

This writer contends that success attained through effort and hard work holds greater value than that based solely on appearance or wealth.

It is important to recognize that individuals who are determined and hardworking can generate wealth and enhance their physical appearance through their abilities. Such individuals can quickly amass wealth because they possess the drive necessary to make money, a fundamental requirement for achieving financial success. Additionally, focusing on improving one's appearance is relatively straightforward in today's world.

However, critics argue that wealth and appearance are vital in advancing quickly in certain professions. They assert that a prerequisite for career advancement is a favorable
 appearance and financial stability, as people often respond positively to attractive and affluent individuals. Furthermore, certain occupations, such as flight attendants, receptionists, and customer service representatives, prioritize hiring attractive employees. Therefore, financial status and appearance are deemed crucial in the workforce.

While this perspective has merit, diligent and determined workers can demonstrate their value and excel in their careers. It is evident that such individuals are likely to leverage their skills and experiences to make a positive impact in their work. By consistently delivering high-quality work, they can create favorable
 impressions and cultivate opportunities for professional growth and advancement. Consequently, academically inclined and hardworking individuals possess the capabilities to compete with their wealthier and more physically appealing counterparts.

In conclusion, while wealth and appearance may facilitate job promotions and align with certain job requirements, educated and determined workers possess the ability and resilience necessary to achieve success.

While some agree that educated adults can actualise their ambitions, I believe that academic education can bring up a useful generation for the countries.

On the one hand, generally, people have some ambitions which have built them since childhood and think that they will be successful if they reach those wishes. They try to run in their ambition road until they reach the target. Additionally, it is accepted by the majority of individuals that educated
 people to achieve more goals in their lives. So, parents encourage their children to continue their education in order to achieve their own aims. A case in point is those students who continued their education not for the purpose of success but just to reach their wishes.

On The other hand, people should be taught to value  others' attempts rather than their achievements. Therefore, the younger generation will distinguish the difference between ambitions and success. Moreover, through academic education students learn morality alongside their subjects which will influence their future manner in their personal life. The educated people without moral values will not be completely beneficial for their country. For instance, we can see some high-level people in society whose behaviour makes them unlikely among others.

Consequently, although some people think that reaching ambitions is the main aim of education, I am of the opinion that education helps people to be more beneficial for society.

To begin with, knowledge is becoming the first priority for the population and most of the graduates from high school want to study at university. As a result, the students' figure increased dramatically and making the distinction between genders is an ineffective method because the number of universities  should be doubled and this is completely a waste of money. Additionally, the figure of teachers will be faced with a shortage and there will be a large gap for educators and the quality of studies will not remain the same , consequently, there will be a significant decrease in community knowledge. For example, in Iran, there are a number of universities that specialize for only one generation and  research compared the grades of these universities with others during the same period there were no differences in figures.

On the other hand, this developed world has all types of communication such as phones and computers and  separation is just a formality and  will not have any beneficial point for increasing their results . Also when the workplace and other parts of the community are blended with two genders there is no point in doing this and it is advantageous to prepare these young people for their future from
 campus.

In conclusion, I believe the isolation of men and women on campus is completely wasteful and the quality  of studies will decrease gradually , additionally ,this process will waste a large amount of money

#idea","Transportation is a cornerstone of major cities, enabling residents to transport from one point to another. The debate over whether cities should make public transportation free of charge in metropolises has been longstanding,with a majority of people praising the benefits that it will bring to the cities. It is my contention that while benefits such as less traffic and improved air quality will be fulfilled afterwards, I would say the drawbacks are solely limited to the accumulation of crowding in alternative transportation vehicles due to the growth. 

Making city transportation costless indeed has several advantages, and one of the most noticeable ones is alleviating congestion in capital cities. Many key cities around the world are facing the challenge of dealing with a large number of private vehicles on the roads, leading to long congestion lines. By providing free transportation, with support from government agencies, citizens are more likely to choose public vehicles for their travel needs. A great example of this is Luxembourg, which became the first country to make public transportation free. As a result, people started to prefer using public transportation instead of relying on their cars. Furthermore, presently, the environmental impact of exhaust gasses has reached  an alarming rate in many major cities such as Shangai, New York and Istanbul where the conditions of public transportation are not an ideal fit. A second advantage emerges here as the number of private vehicles will be substantially decreased if the governors have decided to refuse to charge its citizens for  communal transportation. 

On the contrary side, free transportation may also lead to a condition in which the existing city transportation premises could not handle this instantaneous demand growth, leading towards crowd gatherings on metro and buses. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that in order to establish  sustainable transportation within the cities, the current capacity of transportation facilities should be analyzed and expanded to evade the unanticipated swarm of citizens prior to making free-of-charge transportation publicly available. 

In conclusion, free public transportation in major cities has both merits and demerits. While it can alleviate  traffic congestion and improve air quality, it also poses a threat to cause overcrowding issues.

On the one hand, technological investments provide us with well-equipped opportunities, such as comfort and flexibility. A myriad of well-known companies around the world altered their laws about meetings because of the contribution of technology. In this way, although the squad is in a formal meeting to discuss the firm's goals, they are likely to feel relaxed through the computer. For instance, departments could focus properly on their tasks due to some platforms when the earth struggled with the Corona-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in the office, several strict rules for individuals are regulated by companies. In other words, staff work under pressure in the domain, yet when they strive to overcome some duties, the squad could arrange a break time at home. For instance, personnel might go somewhere since there is no one observing their actions at home.

However, arranging a meeting on the online platform has some major disadvantages, such as distractions and troubles with connection. Generally, over three individuals live in the same home around the world, so institutes may encounter a myriad of issues created by the environment at home. For instance, a person with offspring is likely to be distracted during the meeting. Consequently, they are unlikely to concentrate on their duties. However, companies ought to consider their procedures for meetings since they have remarkable drawbacks for employees.

Although I agree that the former idea can be true in some cases, I would argue that the latter  can boost one's knowledge  about these skills. This essay will discuss both views.

On the one hand, some consider that watching sports plays a pivotal role in fostering many aspects of teamwork and strategy. By observing sports people can see what players are doing, and what actions and strategies they are using in order to win the competition. If someone decides to start sports, it may be a good method as in this approach they can learn more about such skills without being injured. Additionally, people can take photos or record videos during sports and they can keep them for a long time and watch them at home again and again. By looking at what sportsmen or sportswomen are doing, people can learn from them. 

On the other hand, some, including me, believe that participating in  sports can create a deep insight into skills in the mind. The atmosphere in watching sports is not as vibrant as that in engaging sports. When people take part in sports, they can learn more about  crucial skills because they can understand their mistakes during sports, and they will never do it again in the future. If they get injured or do strategies in the wrong way, they are likely to fail and it will give them the feeling of competition, and they can work hard and  gain a depth of sports strategies. Furthermore, when they are in sports, they will have a lot of teammates, and in this way, they can learn more from each other by sharing  what they know about sports and in this way
 they can learn about how to be a part of a team. 

To sum up, while it should be admitted that observing sports events can be a useful method in terms of safety and keeping records for a long time, however, participating in sports offers a different ambience about teamwork and strategy.

On the one hand, it is clear that the authorities should prevent dangerous sports because they have negative effects on the physical health of many players, cause serious accidents, moreover, they can lead to deaths. To illustrate, in Vietnam, many young people have accidents when they are racing yearly.

On the other hand, some crowds argue that the resident should have the freedom to do any  sports and activities because this is the best way for them to explore their abilities and passion in the sports world. Furthermore, it encourages more people to play  sports. For instance, If a person loves swimming, he or she will go to swim more times than other sports. Personally, I think individuals should be allowed to play any sports or activity. Besides, the governments should increase enforcement of dangerous sports laws to improve safety in playing. For example, if a person wants to race, they must undergo  training and have enough protection gear.

I completely disagree with this opinion and think that the way has been started and we will witness the various types of tech-based learning in the near future.

First of all, I believe that thanks to technology, learning has become more appealing and attractive. Even if some suppose that the role of  live interaction can not be neglected,  in my opinion
 the world of virtual colourful concepts is stronger. For example, in terms of learning a second language, it is proved that imposing children under 7 to cartoon series is more valuable and practical than lots of expensive and in-person classes. That's why I predict this teaching style will be pervasive. 

Secondly, different ways of learning based on technology, definitely, lead to saving time and money. In other words, this way, the expenses and times that should be allocated to commute between home and schools or other educational centres can be removed. For instance, considering large cities, the time distance between the source and destination usually is more than 30 minutes. So, via online learning, this time can be devoted to family and other useful activities. Thus, It is obvious that in the long run, this lifestyle would be preferred by the majority of the population.

For instance, even if we are adults, we feel safer if we know that our parents can hear our up or down moods or just can help us with a recipe. So, it encourages a strong and communication-based relationship between parents and children, which is essential to be happy in life for both sides. 

Parents, however, have to respect the intimacy and the independence of their children. The aim of raising children is to let them leave the nest and stay near them but not too close. 

This could maintain trust and reciprocity in the relationship. Otherwise, if this is not respected, it can damage the contact between both of them.

As an aside, children await autonomy, emancipation and living on their own to be happy in life . If parents are too invasive, children become distant and the link could be broken . 

To summarize, whilst parents have to give love and respect to their children to build a strong relationship, they also have to not be too invasive in order to keep a strong link between both of them.

#development","In contemporary times, there is an ongoing trend in terms of occupation, in which individuals are required to relocate to other environments to obtain a better position for their work and they have to abandon their friends or even their immediate families. In this essay, I will exhibit the reasons why the advantages of this situation overshadow the potential drawbacks.

On one side of the condition, employees may face the difficulties of social adaptation. Human, as a social creature, tends to be more suited to the circumstances that are convenient and familiar to them in light of their ability to conform to a certain situation that is different from one to another. For example, teenagers who have graduated from their senior high school and seeking employment may have trouble managing their work-life balance of fulfilling their basic needs and want their families or friends to help them. While one may cope with the hurdle by himself, it could be different for others. This frustrating matter may hinder people from seeking jobs remotely in their home country.

Meanwhile, working abroad offers more benefits than the downside, and one of them is a higher salary. Multitudes who are working in a foreign country often get more salary compared to in their country. For example, Indonesian people with a Master's degree in International Relations can be paid about $80.000 annually by The Apple company, which means around 10 times higher than working in Krakatau Steel company in Indonesia.

Furthermore, people who have an occupation in a country that is far away from their families and friends can benefit from more experience. The invaluable matter that not all men or women have in this world is the life-experience. Having a plethora of acquaintances or work relations costs an arm and leg for people, especially for those who looking for the betterment of their lives. This is because many companies these days will demand a good level of experience for the job applicant and to be posted in a good position in work.

In conclusion, working in a country where people have to be separated from their close friends or their families may lead to an advanced social adaptation, it indeed offers more benefits of salary and experience to enhance one's life quality. Thus, on balance, I remain firmly convinced that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.

Moreover, it allows humans to connect, understand, and relate to one another. While it is true that a reduced number of languages can simplify certain aspects of life, however, the disappearance of languages can cause harmful effects for several reasons.

On one hand, having fewer languages can facilitate international cooperation and foster a deeper understanding among individuals and cultures. By eliminating the language barrier, it becomes easier to effectively share thoughts, exchange ideas, and work together towards common goals. This can greatly enhance collaboration and create a more effective on a global scale. When people can communicate more easily, it strengthens the mutual understanding.

Conversely, it is important to admit that there are a lot of significant drawbacks. Language is closely tied to culture, identity, and heritage, and the loss of languages means the disappearance of distinctive perspectives, knowledge, and traditions. This can lead to the extinction of cultural variety. Additionally, a lack of language differences can limit creativity, innovation, and exploration of ways of thinking and expressing ideas. Language variations offer unique viewpoints for problem-solving, inspiring new ideas, and solutions that drive society forward. 

 

In conclusion, while there may be some advantages to having fewer languages in terms of practical conversation, I respectfully disagree with the statement that preserving language diversity is unimportant. It is crucial to find a balance that values and maintains the richness and liveliness of our global society.

#lives","It is true that science has been growing since the existence of human beings, starting from building simple inventions from wood and stone, such as wheels and creating words (linguistic) in order to improve communication skills. In this day and age, it is becoming increasingly developed in all fields, while the developments have been beyond recognition, closely intertwining with our daily activities. It is argued that scientists should consider human life as their main purpose. I, therefore, strongly agree with this idea and attempt to outline some possible reasons for this.

Scientists and researchers must prioritize the well-being and welfare of humanity to address the problems due to the ever-increasing population of the world. At present, having risen to more than 8 billion, the total population of our planet need new insights so that they can survive side-by-side. Without the capabilities to build apartments and skyscrapers, it would likely be impossible to accommodate individuals as it requires a vast area, which could tend to cause more deforestation and the disappearance of animal species. As a result, thanks to science our generation is able to live with a high quality of life, at least in most areas of the world.

Furthermore, to encounter natural disasters, we need scientists who concentrate on improving our lives. There are many natural events, such as hurricanes, infectious diseases, and tsunamis, which might eliminate human being's existence. These are forecasted or prevented by scientists who focus on our well-being and by inventions due to their research. For example, the outbreak of the coronavirus could be far worse if scientists were working on subjects that were not related to our lives. Therefore, we couldn't survive catastrophes unless the scientists put people's needs first.

In conclusion, I believe it is necessary for universities and institutions to give priority to the human race, as our populace has been experiencing a steep rise and accommodating all of us needs the contribution of scientists and the invention of state-of-the-art innovations. In addition, to resist natural disasters, scientists should focus on human beings.

For example, reading the news, calling a friend or family member or doing simpler tasks such as relaxation. Additionally, recent studies indicated that the majority number of accidents are caused by an individual, as a result, if we replace drivers with a program the number will drop significantly and passengers will reach their destinations in the safest way. For instance , tesla cars have a program that can measure other drivers' habits and estimate their next move also they can share information with other cars and this algoritem
 is able to avoid dangerous activities and maximize safety.

On the other hand, drivers have a large impact on industries and have different responsibilities if we eliminate their jobs, they will be unsatisfied and also face  many problems. However, any new technology needs some staff and equipment so governments can prepare some courses to teach those people to be adapted to new methods and they can fill this gap just with some education.

In conclusion, In my opinion, I totally agree with the replacement of drivers with new technology because it will help  humankind and reduce dangers. Moreover, there are some problems , although, those could easily be solved  by some plans.

However, they also can influence vulnerable groups like kids.That is the reason why it caused some people to think that it is best to avoid targeting children in advertisements. Personally speaking, I believe that advertisements should not target children, as it is crucial to protect them from harmful marketing practices. 

Certainly, everyone should be able to make their own choices about what they want or buy, and ads can be helpful in showing us different options. However, it is undeniable that not all advertisements are good. Some of them use tactics on sensitive groups, such as juveniles. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that it is done responsibly , especially when it comes to sensitive audiences like children. 

From my perspective, restrictions on targeting young people in advertisements can be beneficial. Children may not have the same level of understanding as adults and can be easily tricked. Fancy advertising techniques can lead to numerous unhealthy habits, such as excessive consumption of snacks or drinks, which can have long-term health issues. Companies and governments need to be careful and make sure ads are fair, especially for kids.

In conclusion, while some people may argue that individuals should have the freedom to choose, I believe that advertisements should be limited, especially when it comes to targeting children. Being responsible for young people in advertisements can be profitable for their overall well-being and development.

This trend stems from various factors, notably the omnipresence of technology and the allure of indoor conveniences. This essay will delve into the multifaceted reasons behind young people's dwindling engagement with nature and propose nuanced strategies to invigorate their connection with the natural world.

One pivotal factor contributing to the preference for indoor activities among young individuals is the ubiquitous influence of technology in their daily lives. The ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social media platforms, and immersive video games has cultivated a sedentary lifestyle, wherein the allure of virtual experiences often overshadows the benefits of outdoor exploration. Moreover, the allure of indoor amenities, such as climate control, comfort, and tailored entertainment systems, presents a compelling reason for young people to opt for indoor leisure activities.

To foster a renewed appreciation for the natural environment among young people, multifaceted interventions are warranted. Educational institutions can serve as catalysts for change by integrating outdoor activities into their curriculum, encompassing field trips, nature excursions, and robust environmental education programs. Early exposure to the wonders of nature can instill
 in young individuals a profound appreciation for the outdoors, fostering resilience and nurturing a sense of environmental stewardship. Additionally, community-driven initiatives, such as outdoor sports clubs, environmental conservation projects, and immersive outdoor adventure programs, can provide avenues for young people to partake in meaningful outdoor experiences within a supportive social framework.

In conclusion, the declining engagement of many young people with the natural environment during leisure time is a concerning trend that warrants concerted action. By addressing the pervasive influence of technology, promoting outdoor experiential learning in educational settings, and fostering community-based initiatives, it is conceivable to rekindle young individuals' affinity with nature. Ultimately, bridging the gap between young people and the natural environment is imperative for fostering a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the world around us.

The key to many problems humans face is science for reducing hunger, finding new cures, and creating a better economy. However, there is a strong argument that the public should be the priority and the essential goal of science is to make humans live better. This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.

To begin with, the development of science benefits people’s lives. Many invented cures and discoveries of technology bring people to a new era. For example, a hundred year
 before, someone who was infected by the flu close to died since there was no knowledge about the cure and how to prevent it. However, science has been growing, scientists invented the vaccine, and the public nowadays can live side by side with the flu. As a result, science saved many lives.

Furthermore, science aims to broaden people’s knowledge to be aware of the environment. Many nations in this world do not have a good geography. Africa and some parts of Asia have severe drought, and most of them cannot produce their own food because of the bad soil. In addition, scientists discovered how to make some vegetation suitable for this condition, and they did it. For instance, In Indonesia, there is a place with poor land conditions, but with some experiments on vegetation, nowadays, they have poor land conditions, but with some experiments on greens, nowadays, they are able to grow some plants that suit poor soil. This helps society to improve their lives by growing their own food.

Although the former idea is so beneficial for children as a way of growing up more careful people, I would argue that the latter concept is more relevant.

On the one hand, some say that all children should be responsible for extra obligatories . When they take on additional responsibilities, they are likely to be attentive and responsible people in the future. As they understand the great importance of extra responsibilities, they can adapt to tackle  a lot of problems on their own without asking other people as a skilled and professional person in the future, and in this way, they can be  good members of  society. 

On the other hand, some, including me, argue that children should live their lives beyond  school. Firstly, childhood is given to a person once only. Children should live their childhoods, they should hang out with their friends, they should play outdoor games with their peers. Children should not be seen as  figures who should be responsible for many things at an early age. Additionally, not all children can deal with taking on a lot of responsibilities because  the capacity of all children is not equal, not all of them are  gifted people who have the ability to solve many issues on their own. So, if they are forced to do this, it can result in a heavy burden on their mental well-being.

To sum up, while children being responsible for further obligatory is a good way to become  skilled people in  society, they should have the right to entertain themselves outside the academic life because   childhood is given once only, and considering all children's capacities.

#people","The disparity in salaries between senior positions and junior workers within the same company has sparked debate regarding its justification. While some argue that this wage gap is unjustified and perpetuates inequality, others contend that it is warranted based on factors such as experience, expertise, and leadership responsibilities. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on this matter.

Those who oppose the salary gap between senior and junior positions argue that it is unfair and undermines principles of equality and meritocracy. They contend that younger workers often possess comparable skills and qualifications to their senior counterparts and should be compensated accordingly. Additionally, maintaining a significant wage differential may demotivate junior employees and hinder their career progression, leading to dissatisfaction and turnover within the organization.

However, proponents of higher salaries for senior positions argue that remuneration should reflect the level of responsibility, experience, and value brought to the organization. Senior employees typically have years of experience and expertise in their field, along with leadership roles that entail greater accountability and decision-making authority. As such, they argue that higher salaries for senior positions are justified as a recognition of these contributions and responsibilities.

In my opinion, while experience and expertise are undoubtedly valuable, the extent of the wage gap between senior and junior positions should be scrutinized to ensure fairness and transparency. Organizations should implement clear and objective criteria for determining salaries, taking into account factors such as performance, qualifications, and market standards. Additionally, efforts should be made to provide opportunities for career advancement and skill development for junior employees, thereby bridging the gap between senior and junior positions over time.

In conclusion, the debate over salary differentials between senior and junior positions reflects competing priorities regarding fairness, meritocracy, and organizational value. While experience and leadership responsibilities warrant higher salaries for senior positions, it is essential to ensure that wage differentials are justified and transparent. By fostering a culture of equity and opportunity, organizations can promote employee satisfaction and long-term success.

While these historical settlements may have been well-suited and livable for people in previous centuries, they often face various problems in the modern era. In this essay, I will discuss the problems caused by the preservation of old towns and cities and propose solutions to address these challenges.

One of the primary problems associated with old towns and cities is outdated infrastructure and urban planning. Many of these settlements were designed for a smaller population and less vehicular traffic, leading to congestion, inadequate transportation systems, and deteriorating infrastructure. Additionally, historic buildings may lack modern amenities and compliance with safety and accessibility standards, posing risks to residents and visitors alike.

Furthermore, the preservation of old towns and cities can exacerbate socioeconomic disparities and gentrification. As these areas become popular tourist destinations or desirable neighborhoods
 for affluent residents, property values rise, displacing long-term residents and eroding the cultural fabric of the community. This phenomenon often leads to the loss of affordable housing and the marginalization of lower-income residents.

To address these problems, proactive measures must be taken to balance preservation with modernization and inclusivity. Firstly, investments should be made in upgrading infrastructure and urban amenities to meet the needs of residents and visitors while preserving the historical character of the area. This may involve improving transportation networks, restoring historic buildings, and enhancing public spaces for recreational and cultural activities.

Additionally, policies should be implemented to promote equitable development and affordable housing in old towns and cities. This could include the preservation of affordable housing stock, incentivizing mixed-income development, and providing support for local businesses and community initiatives. Engaging residents and stakeholders in the decision-making process is also crucial to ensure that preservation efforts are inclusive and sustainable.

In conclusion, while the preservation of old towns and cities presents challenges related to infrastructure, gentrification, and socioeconomic disparities, proactive measures can mitigate these issues. By investing in modernization while preserving historical integrity and promoting equitable development, old towns and cities can continue to thrive as vibrant and livable communities for generations to come.

#curriculum","The lack of emphasis on teaching children about the value of money and financial management within the school curriculum is a glaring oversight with significant ramifications. I firmly agree that financial literacy is a critical skill that should be integrated into the educational framework from an early age. In this essay, I will elaborate on the importance of financial education in schools and discuss whether the current state of affairs represents a positive or negative development.

First and foremost, instilling financial literacy in children equips them with essential life skills necessary for navigating the complexities of the modern world. Understanding concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions and cultivate responsible financial habits. Without proper guidance, young adults may fall prey to financial pitfalls such as overspending, debt accumulation, and lack of savings, leading to long-term financial instability and stress.

Moreover, integrating financial education into the school curriculum promotes socioeconomic equality by leveling
 the playing field and providing all students, regardless of their background, with the tools to achieve financial independence. By fostering a culture of financial responsibility and empowerment, schools can help mitigate the cycle of poverty and equip future generations with the skills necessary to build a secure financial future for themselves and their families.

Furthermore, financial literacy education aligns with the broader goals of education in fostering holistic development and preparing students for adulthood. Just as schools teach subjects like mathematics and language arts to impart essential cognitive skills, teaching financial literacy ensures that students develop the practical skills needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected global economy.

In conclusion, the absence of financial literacy education in schools represents a significant oversight with far-reaching implications. Integrating financial education into the curriculum is imperative to empower students with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the intricacies of personal finance and achieve long-term financial well-being. Therefore, I strongly believe that making financial literacy a core component of the school curriculum is not only necessary but also a profoundly positive development for society as a whole.

First, there is a risk of losing focus on long-term educational goals, as hands-on work experience or the lure of travel can shift priorities away from academic ambitions. In addition, a break from academic learning can lead to a loss of study habits and momentum, making it difficult to readjust to academic rigor
. For example, a child who graduated with good grades may lose passion for his or her academics. However, I believe this can be overcome if one has strong ambition and decisions from the start.

Taking a gap year can help individuals clear their heads and gain a better understanding of their career interests and aspirations, leading to more informed decisions regarding their academic and professional pursuits. In addition, traveling
 can broaden one's horizons, offering exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking, which can enhance creativity and adaptability in future studies. Finally, gaining real-world experience can provide practical skills that are not taught in the classroom, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. As an illustration, a student who volunteers and contributes to the community will certainly be useful in college life later on.

In conclusion, following the above statements, I believe that the advantages of postponing college outweigh the disadvantages because it can prepare students well and thoroughly. On the other hand, if some teenagers are able to stay in the direction they set from the beginning and their ambitions, I think the disadvantages will be lost.

#television","The debate between attending live sporting events and watching them from the comfort of home has been a perennial topic among sports enthusiasts. Both options offer distinct advantages, and personal preferences often dictate one's choice. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives using personal examples and evaluate whether this trend constitutes a positive or negative development.

Attending a live sporting event is an electrifying experience unparalleled by any other. The atmosphere pulsates with excitement as fans unite to support their teams, creating an immersive and unforgettable spectacle. I vividly recall the exhilaration of being in the stadium during a soccer match, surrounded by passionate fans chanting in unison and witnessing the game's drama unfold in real-time
. The sense of camaraderie and shared enthusiasm fosters a sense of belonging and community, making live events a truly memorable experience.

On the other hand, watching sporting events at home offers unparalleled convenience and comfort. With advances in technology, home viewing experiences now rival the thrill of being at the stadium. From the comfort of my living room, I can enjoy high-definition broadcasts, multiple camera angles, and expert commentary, all while lounging in my favorite
 chair with snacks readily available. Moreover, watching at home eliminates the hassle of travel, parking, and long queues, allowing for a more relaxed and stress-free experience.

As for whether this trend is positive or negative, it ultimately depends on individual preferences and circumstances. Live sporting events promote social interaction and community engagement, fostering a sense of unity among fans. However, the rise of home viewing options has democratized access to sports, allowing individuals who may not have the means or opportunity to attend live events to enjoy the spectacle from afar.

In conclusion, both attending live sporting events and watching them at home offer unique benefits and experiences. While I personally enjoy the thrill of being in the stadium, I acknowledge the convenience and accessibility of home viewing options. Ultimately, whether this trend is positive or negative depends on one's perspective and the values they prioritize.

To begin with, there are several benefits from the Internet revolution in our modern life. Frist
 thanks to the Internet it is possible to have communication throughout the world which might result in cultural exchange among different societies. Exchanging cultures would help individuals to have a new perspective on the world. Take social media as an example, people from various communities are able to find friends from other countries and cultures. Moreover, global knowledge is another positive point of easy access. For example, if all people have a reliable Internet, they might use it to search for new knowledge and learn them
.

However, this revolution might have some downsides as well. The prime concern is about the privacy and security of the users. The more increasing number of users the more risk of increasing rate of cybercrimes. A good illustration of those crimes might be identity thefts that are able to steal our personal information like  passwords and usernames. In addition, another possible issue is that still there are significant disparities in the access and  quality of the Internet in many parts of the world. For instance, in  developing countries, people are dealing with the quality of the Internet. 

To sum up, although there are clear benefits from this revolution based on easy access , there would be some problems that can not be neglected.

#roads","In a 
contemporary society, governments have been taking a variety of measures to encourage people to use cars less. Some people claim that imposing tolls on roads in heavy traffic can be the best way to reduce their car usage. I strongly support this idea from the environmental and psychological perspectives.

Examining the former standpoint to
 begin with, the reduction in amount
 of traffic on busy roads due to implementing a road toll can be a contributor to mitigating the situation of the present serious air pollution. In fact, there is substantial scientific evidence that backs up the proposition that the energy consumption efficiency of vehicles deteriorates on a road with heavy traffic, which is one of the major factors of pollutants emitted by them. Therefore, if individuals avoid busy roads because of road tolls, they can become more environmentally friendly.

Shifting focus
 to the latter standpoint, people will try to avoid passing through busy streets if a road toll is implemented because they potentially have a psychological tendency to try to avoid even small expenses. For example, many countries have abolished free plastic bags service in shops. Even though each bag costs consumers a little, many of them quit purchasing the bags and instead, they now bring their own eco-bags. I believe that this example can be applicable to the problem of people’s heavy car usage. Hence, if a road poll is not expensive, the psychological impact on car users can be huge.

To reiterate, although it would be challenging for governments to forbid people from using cars, I am firmly convinced that imposing tolls on busy roads is the most effective strategy to alleviate people’s car usage in terms of the environment and psychology.

Therefore, some teachers and parents suggest schools increase subjects that provide international news for students to study. Whereas some people look upon requiring students to study international news as an efficient method to improve students's knowledge, others refer to it as a meaningless idea. As for my perspectives, I am in favour of the former, and the reasons will be elaborated on as follows.

First, studying international news is a way to enrich student's knowledge. That is, students can obtain more knowledge from news, such as local cultures, food, climate and so on. Take me for example, my college teacher had arranged an assignment to let students search foreign news about food and compare it with Taiwanese food. Through that class, I not only learned lots of knowledge about desserts but also learned about their foreign history from them, because desserts were created based on different historical periods. Due to the compulsory assignment, I indeed learned more information, which school textbooks did not have, and started to interested
 in exploring differences between countries.

Moreover, Inputting international news can cultivate students' critical thinking. To be more specific, by comparing differences between countries, students will have their own opinions and feedback, which helps teenagers to think and criticize. According to a study conducted by National Taiwan University, inputting more international news to children from 12 to 18 years, the logic and the 
critical thinking of students are better than those who seldom obtain international information. The result shows that the earlier the children start to read news, the better logical thinking they have.

In conclusion, based on the aforementioned, reading international news has positive effects on junior students due to acquiring more knowledge and cultivating critical thinking.

 their lives. Although  developing this work pattern may lead to an active lifestyle   as well as financial prosperity , however, the destructive effects of this issue on having a professional career should not be ignored.

Taking an active life approach into account, it is obvious that involving in two or more jobs means a higher level of income. Consequently, an individual can have different hobby choices and can  participate in various types of entertainment; this issue avoids a sedentary lifestyle and in the long run we witness of 
shaping a happy characteristic with less tension and stress.

On the other hand, this subject should not be neglected that engaging in more careers simultaneously, may result in fatigue. For instance, consider a situation in which a person is working as an insurance specialist in a company at the time and accepts consulting others during off hours. This person , definitely has a pleasant salary, but is there any time to devote to family or take part in different social or entertainment activities? So, the only result is saving money and different types of diseases related to extra work and fewer breaks.

To sum up, creating a balanced work-life trend is  an essential factor to have a successful personality. To achieve this goal, considering the merits and demerits of being involved in more than one job, it is suggested to concentrate on one career and endeavour hard to become more professional and earn more money.

Some believe that this can result in various drawbacks, while others hold the belief that these individuals might be beneficial for a community in some ways. Personally, I am a firm believer that the disadvantages of this statement outweigh its benefits in a variety of aspects. 

First and foremost, by having a majority of elders, society has to provide various hospitals and caring places in order to take care of these groups of people in many aspects such as their medications as well as their mental health. This statement would become an issue in the long run, which can make governments spend most of the money coming from taxes to be spent on providing health care places. In other words, there would be no rooms left for other facilities like schools for children or workplaces. In addition to that, these hospitals require a vast majority of doctors and staff to work, which may be a concerning issue for governments to provide a proper number of professionals in this field. 

While elders can be beneficial to adolescents regarding their life and work experience, they would not be eligible to work since they require care and help 24/7, which can become problematic. Furthermore, if the number of ageing individuals increases, societies will face a lack of workforce. Lack of a proper workforce will put a country in serious danger. For instance, in China, the number of elders is growing rapidly each year due to their large population. Therefore, this country is facing difficulties in their working industry, and as a result of that, youngsters have to work more than usual to fully satisfy the needs of companies, which makes them tired and can not work efficiently. 

To sum up, I strongly believe that the growth in the ageing population might not be a good sign for communities, since this group of people are now retired and need great help, which can cause serious problems for a country.

.

In my opinion, two main factors are to blame for increasing the crimes. Firstly, lack of suitable education. It is clear that there is a positive correlation between education and crime.The number of crimes in countries with high-quality  education systems is much less than the countries with poor education systems.Secondly, Lack of Job opportunities could be another reason for crime increasing. When people do not have a proper job that can make money and occupy their time efficiently , they will start to earn money in  illegal ways  which causes increased mass.For Example, the number of robberies in a poor country with a high rate of unemployment is much more than in the countries which have a good job market.

There are different ways that can be dealt with this problem, but I believe that the government's role is very important. In the first step, governments should try to improve the education system and provide some facilities so that primary education be
 free for all citizens. They also should review the school's curricula and carry out some reforms in the curriculum content of schools with the aim of acquaintance of students with the drawbacks of delinquency. the second useful step could be trying to provide more jobs and improve the job market in order to reduce the number of jobless population. For instance, facilitating the running of factories and huge stores in densely populated areas  leads to hiring a large group of residents.

In Conclusion, The number of violations and crimes is growing for several reasons such as lack of a proper education system or high rate of unemployment which  require the participation of the government to create conditions for improving the education system and labour market situation.

I think it depends on the type of work and this development could be positive for some occupations but not for all positions.

On the one hand, some jobs do not need physical participation because need mental processes so by reforming technology it is easier to work from a distance area, as a result, it is an advantageous method . Subsequently, this reduces in physical existence of office locations, and the size of relevant buildings will decrease so the company can save more money because they do not need specious places. Additionally, when employees do not go to workplaces the amount
 of commuters will reduce and it can upgrade environmental quality gradually . For example, during the pandemic governments introduced websites  for the population to respond to their needs, staff were behind their computers and they did it so effortlessly, communicating with citizens and solving their problems  during that period in a large number of capital cities air quality increased dramatically.

For example, judges and lawyers are in very sensitive locations and they might be targeted by cyber-attacks during their online courts so being active in face-to-face locations will eliminate this risk and will not be easily distributed by foreigners.

In conclusion, In my opinion, upgrading methods of doing occupations is a good development,however , just for low-risk levels because it reduces emissions and money spent but for high-risk levels, it will be better to keep the classical way to prevent unwanted dangers.

It is an undeniable fact that every person's initial teacher is his parents and the basic skills should be taught by them. If a child does not learn about spending and saving money skills, he will definitely face huge financial problems in his future life. In addition, younger generations try to copy whatever their friends do such as overspending money on unnecessary stuff. Since they just think about having fun and being popular among their friends, they do not pay attention to the essential need for money management. A case in point is the students who bully their classmates by spending more money on their needs.

It is generally acknowledged that there should be a subject in school to teach students about money management. Also, Parents must inform their children about  money's role in their lives and try to train them in its management through some games. Moreover, it seems young individuals are grown enough to know the value of money. They should write a detailed plan for it monthly and finally learn about money management by experience and trial.

Consequently, it is advisable that some appropriate actions should be taken both in schools and homes to teach youngsters money management skills as  was discussed, in order to prevent future problems in their lives.

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","#countries

#people
#life","Nowadays, choosing from single-sex and multi-sex schools has become increasingly popular in most nations. While some parents argue that studying with peers of the same gender is the preferable option, others prefer multi-gender peers as they provide different life skills than single-sex schools. In my view, I agree with the statement that children go to co-educational institutions because youths can gain various experiences and knowledge and I will demonstrate why mixed-sexual schools are the best in this essay.

As education is considered an important integral part of bringing up our next generation, the first thing that has to be done by parents is which schools they send their children whether it will be single-gender or mixed ones. There are more advantages if people choose multi-sex schools than other ones. Because it provides an opportunity to interact and deal with children who are in a different sexual category. For example, knowing and observing the male attitudes and behaviours while learning in class will help a female student gain social skills with men, which means that they are further used to overcoming and managing challenges in their own family and their careers. 

In addition to the benefit mentioned above, another advantage why I prefer co-educational places is that they foster a sense of biological psychological identities between females and males. As a result in children acknowledging and understanding biological characteristics, they are able to distinguish strengths and weaknesses in both physical and intellectual levels. For example, a woman cannot lift a heavy item because their body is not designed to perform such heavy physical work as miners, for instance, while men master it. Instead, they have a reproduction ability and a better quality of caring and loving ones. In other words, men cannot give birth and do not have much stamina in pain compared to women. 

To conclude, today, education institutions offer programs that specialize in gender, such as single-sexual and mixed genders. Although some people think single-sexual schools are better, others believe that mixed-gender schools because they think that their children can obtain various experiences and skills such as sexual differentiation and the capacities of one of each gender, which I agree with.

#basis
#time","In today’s fast-paced world, the issue of walking in daily life among fewer people has become a vital concern. It is said that the number of people walking daily has been decreasing gradually. However, this problem can be tackled by organizing appealing activities.

     One of the significant reasons why fewer people prefer walking is that some technological applications which supply travelling, including escalators and lifts are very prevalent in public places. These amenities help people to move higher easily and without any physical activities despite of 
staying up on their feet. It is evident that there are stairs which are created for those who want to walk as much as possible, but few people prefer walking up stairs rather than using lifts. Moreover, as people’s living standards are developing, they are more likely to go to an array of sports facilities such as yoga and gym which are more interesting and efficient for improving a health level than taking a stroll.

    In order to encourage individuals to do more walking than they did, various interesting methods can be implemented to address the problem. People can be encouraged by art and paintings. For instance, nowadays, the government is trying to add more spectacular paintings on the walls of stairs and streets to get more people active daily. In addition, there are some applications which give money to people for the number of their footsteps. This is the better option for those who want to engage in physical activities.

   In conclusion, a growing number of people dislike walking for several reasons and this problem can be addressed with some measures suggested.

On the one hand, more and more people are depending on the Internet negatively. This causes a lot of young adults to be physically and mentally weak. For example, teenagers who have a game addiction spend all day long lying on a bed or sofa to play games. Consequently, they refuse to go to school or go out for social activities. Another problem of
 the Internet is the increase of criminals. The cyber environment creates perfect opportunities for the malefactors to approach their ""prey"" just by some clicks. Frightenedly, it is not only limited to cybercrime but also to real-life transgression when personal data is

Furthermore, the Internet also can unite individuals from all over the world without expensive fees. For instance, social media like Facebook, X or Snapchat provide people with a platform to connect. Last but not least, the Internet plays an important role in encouraging the growth of international trade so that companies from two distinct nations can easily research for each other and collaborate with no doubt.

Firstly,non-conventional methods can have detrimental effects on patients' health.Although taking alternative medicines like herbal remedies can help to alleviate the symptoms of  problems related to health,there is no evidence that it can create other health challenges or not.People who use plants for dealing with health problems can have allergies to them and it can lead to other problems,even if it can lead to their death .For instance,in recent years,we can see that there have been many people who died because of the side effects of herbal remedies.

Furthermore,even if these methods do not have an opposite effect on individuals, they can lead to further growth of diseases and addiction to these methods.Using alternative treatments and medicines can mitigate this problem only in the short term,and individuals are obliged to utilize it regularly  and these methods cannot eradicate this problem fully.Consequently,over time,it can grow further and can result in grave health problems.For example,a person who has a headache use these methods and alleviate it for only a few hours.After a certain time,the headache starts again and they have to take alternative medicine and in this case,it creates endless addiction.However,if  individuals  have problems pertaining to their health visits to  healthcare services,doctors can solve this problem effectively and they can escape from long-term dependency.

In conclusion,I am of the opinion that non-conventional method of remedies for health is a negative development and  can lead to grave health problems and even death.

#exploration","Various controversies have emerged as to whether the government should invest enormous money in space exploration. Some people state that investment in space research is a waste of money. From my perspective, however, the benefits of space search far outweigh its drawbacks.

One primary reason is the development of technology. Many cutting-edge technology was invented in the space inspection stage at first. The relevant authorities put tremendous funds into the improvement of space technology and most of those state-of-the-art space technologies would eventually be used by normal people. For instance, the Internet was initially invented for the purpose of communicating with space crafts and space stations. However, after several years of improvement, this technology was finally utilized by everyone on their personal devices, such as smartphones and laptops.

On the other hand, some opponents of space exploration stated that instead of spending on this, the government should focus on upgrading the infrastructure. If the government puts too much money into the improvement of space technology, there will be no ample funds to renovate some basic facilities. Nonetheless, investment in space technology not only has a remarkable impact on space exploration but also establishes the reputation of the countries. Therefore, many international companies might want to invest in the industry in this area. This will give those states more funding to build infrastructure.

By way of conclusion, I firmly believe that it is worth it to invest the space exploration. While some people claim that it might eclipse the investment for other issues. However, it can not only improve the expansion of technology but also stimulate foreign funding in domestic industry.

On one hand, opponents of government funding for art and culture often cite more pressing needs, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They argue that limited financial resources should be directed towards addressing these fundamental societal needs rather than investing in what they perceive as non-essential luxuries. Additionally, some critics question the efficacy of government involvement in cultural endeavors
, expressing concerns about potential mismanagement and inefficiency in the allocation of funds. They argue that private patronage or market-driven support may be more effective in sustaining artistic and cultural initiatives.

On the other hand, proponents of government funding for cultural activities argue that such investments can yield significant benefits for society as a whole. They contend that art and culture play a crucial role in fostering social cohesion, promoting national identity, and enhancing quality of life. Government support can ensure accessibility to cultural experiences for all segments of the population, regardless of socioeconomic status. Moreover, funding for cultural activities can stimulate economic growth by attracting tourism, supporting creative industries, and generating employment opportunities.

In my opinion, while I acknowledge the validity of concerns about competing priorities for government funding, I believe that supporting art and culture is essential for the enrichment and well-being of society. Cultural activities contribute to the fabric of our collective identity and provide avenues for creativity, expression, and connection. Therefore, I advocate for government funding to be allocated judiciously to support a vibrant and inclusive cultural landscape that benefits individuals and communities alike.

The more the world is easily connected, the more the new generation should learn new languages. In my opinion, there are lots of benefits to begin for studying  foreign languages in primary school rather than starting in secondary school.

Regarding good timing,beginning to learn a foreign language in a primary academy is much better than after the age. One of the benefits for young students who initially studied in this primary school period is that most young people could effectively learn  new things, compared to the older ones. They also have less content requiring to 
focus on lessons compared to the fields in secondary academies such as math and science. Moreover, it is a golden period for these youth to learn new things and they are capable of getting much input without any concerns in kids' lives. For example, the young could concentrate on the subjects without helping their parents do household chores because of being too young. 

Even though there are a plethora of advantages to studying earlier, there is a drawback to this issue concerning kids' parents. It significantly costs for English or foreign programs compared to the standard. For example, the price for a normal course may be around $2,000 a term, while the parents might need to pay double or triple times for the English plan depending on pricing for each institute. 

To conclude, the pros noticeably outweigh the cons with regards to the best learning age,which they are less concerned with and the golden youth in that time. However, the parents of all the young students might need to spend money on specific programs which could encourage them to get
 better well-being life in the future.

On the one hand. we have a group of people who are scared to leave their places of birth in search of a better life elsewhere. They are afraid of changing environments because they are used to their own type of lifestyle and they are afraid to move to new places where they would want to start learning and adapting to new lifestyles.

On the other hand, there is a growing number of people who are not content with their local environment.

#person","First impressions are a fundamental aspect of human interaction. We form quick judgments about others upon meeting them, and these initial evaluations can significantly impact our decisions and relationships. While this tendency serves a purpose in some situations, it can also lead to misinterpretations in others.

First impressions hold considerable weight in professional settings, particularly during job interviews. Employers often base their initial assessment of a candidate on factors like appearance, body language, and communication skills. In fast-paced recruitment processes, a positive first impression can be crucial for securing a desired position, especially in roles that involve public interaction like sales or customer service. Here, a confident demeanor
 and professional presentation can create a lasting positive memory for the interviewer.

However, relying solely on first impressions can be detrimental when forming personal connections. Cultural differences, clothing choices, and even momentary behavior
 can create misleading judgments.  For example, one might encounter someone whose attire seems unconventional, leading to an initial impression of a lack of experience or professionalism. This perception, as my husband discovered during a chance encounter on a train, could be entirely inaccurate. After striking up a conversation, he learned the seemingly unassuming individual was a distinguished military officer in his home country. This anecdote highlights how first impressions, especially when encountering people from diverse backgrounds, can be unreliable indicators of character or capability.

In conclusion, the value of a first impression depends on the context.  While they play a crucial role in professional assessments, relying solely on them for personal connections can lead to missed opportunities.

#women","There are some nations where military service is compulsory for teenagers just after they finish high school, either men or women. I disagree with this policy because some people are not prepared to do this kind of training and some of them do not have the required skills.

To begin, the main problem is the fact of forcing anyone around 18 years old to attend
 the Armed Forces. Some people perhaps do not like this type of service or sometimes do have not the proper physical abilities. As a result, these people will become bad soldiers and others cannot be selected. 

For example, in Brazil, when a boy complete 18 years old, he has to apply for compulsory military service. The majors are dismissed, by chance, due to the limitation of vacations. So, some people more prepared to do this service cannot attend, whereas others not prepared can be chosen. Moreover, this period of working for the Armed Forces can difficult for further studies to enrol on a university. Considering that the usual time for this compulsory job is around 1 year, people have to wait this time to apply for tertiary education. As a consequence, these young men will be late to attend university and work in the future.

On the other hand, there are some benefits to adopting this system, especially in developing countries where there are few options for further education. So, the military service can be an opportunity for poor people to begin a career. Additionally, military service is a good way to make new friends and learn some values such as honour, discipline, and responsibility.

To conclude, I believe that this sort of service should be optional. Only men or women that like this area should do it. In this way, the results for the country will be better and people will attend more happily.

Others like their lives to stay the same, and they do not change their usual habits. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","#people

#habits","In contemporary society, people have debated whether a change of scenery and routine has helped to enhance and improve their lives, whereas some prefer for their lifestyle to remain unchanged. Personally, I strongly advocate the former view. However, while it is true that this phenomenon is primarily attributed to the momentous mental well-being and cognitive stimulation it offers, it can also prosper safety and security. 

It is imperative to recognize the paramount benefit a new scenery can have on someone’s mentality. To illustrate this, Psychologist, Dr. Edward Sullen, conducted a study at Harvard University where he was able to decrease depression among his patients by 35% just by introducing them to a concatenation of new experiences. Moreover, it is essential to underscore the cognitive stimulation that new routines can have on someone’s intellectual abilities when frequently being introduced to new hobbies or experiences. Thus, it is my contention that change could be extremely beneficial. 

Although there is merit in the argument that an unchangeable lifestyle can provide security and safety. For instance, Ingo Farming is a family company that has flourished in the vineyard business for over 500 years, in which they remain to what they know - winemaking. Given this, it is evident that some people find comfort in doing what they know and get anxious if forced to move out of their comfort zones. Hence, deciding to stay with one's usual habits can make someone feel secure in their life. 

In conclusion, the decision to change is twofold; some believe that it can improve mental health and cognitive function, while some say it can bring comfort in
 one's daily life. In my opinion, it is more beneficial to participate in new experiences. If more people decide to coalesce and explore more life experiences, then some might exceed in happiness.

Some people claim that subjects which do not have any positive impacts on individuals’ academic lives and knowledge should be taken off  the school systems, however, I am not on the same side with them. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will elucidate both aspects and try to give a reasonable conclusion from my viewpoint. 

First and foremost, proponents of the idea which is about removing non-academic subjects from the school syllabus allege that these subjects do not matter in pupils’ education, they see these kinds of classes as a waste of time. For instance, students who participate in these classes can be attracted by these kinds of activities, and as a result   , students may ignore other subjects in order to show great performance and enhance their skills related to these fields. Moreover, if someone has innate skills and is the best among their peers, they can be directed to these sectors by  professionals, and in the long run, they will not have any time for their education.

Turning to the other side of the coin, it is an inevitable fact that the importance of co-educational branches of study is various. To exemplify, students need breaks and refresh their minds between tiring classes to concentrate on each subject well, while some can do it easily during the breaks, for others engaging in physical activities can be more effective as it promotes some individuals with a sense of fulfilment, relaxation and being away from the stress. Additionally, naturally gifted students can gain experience and improve their skills by attending these kinds of branches.

In conclusion, after being manifested both points, while some people are convinced that the subjects which are not related to academic studies should be eliminated from the list of subjects, I am absolutely against  this attitude. From my point of view, all subjects are important for students and it is ideal to strike a balance between both academic and physical courses of study.

This trend has sparked a controversy among the advocates and critics, both presenting valid arguments. I wholeheartedly agree that more time is given to book knowledge in comparison to practical knowledge that is more necessary.  

  

 To begin with, the primary reason is when more focus is left on learning facts and figures, then learners can score excellent score in their exams, but they will not have any practical knowledge. For instance, there are a certain number of schools in Punjab that render computer education from books related to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel in class, but their students do not know how and where to use these sites in daily life. Thus, this is just a waste of time. Furthermore, with advancements in technology, most multinational companies prefer to hire employees based on their skills, rather than academic scores. Hence, making students devote more time to learning facts is not useful in the future anymore as it is not helpful in career growth.  

  

 Moreover, it is cheap to provide book knowledge to children, instead of providing them with real equipment to learn from. It costs enormously high to school authorities when students do real experiments with chemicals in chemistry class. Although most institutes spend more time on books, not on skills, it is essential to include experiments in students because they help adults to 
see reality and analyze their abilities to choose their careers.  

  

 To conclude, as per the matrimonial mentioned above, I can say that most colleges try to spend more on learning facts, but I believe that it is not beneficial for the tutees. Thus, practical teaching acquires equal importance.

 since the absence of a diverse range of veggies and fruits will have detrimental effects on several regions. Conversely, some individuals within the community may possess a surplus of resources. The following paragraphs will explain the drawbacks of the perspective and provide pertinent examples. 

Firstly, it is important to note that many regions throughout the globe exhibit distinct climatic conditions that might potentially disrupt agricultural growth. Certain strategies thrive in warm weather, while others thrive in cold weather. For instance, a coconut needs a humid and warm atmosphere in order to thrive and endure. Consequently, regions with low temperatures would lack access to these items if they are not delivered, along with several other food items. As a result, the population will experience negative consequences since the body needs essential vitamins derived from vegetables and fruits. 

Furthermore, several crops provide a substantial quantity of items that need fast consumption. Otherwise, they will get obsolete and become obsolete. For example, it is necessary to consume fruits such as strawberries, bananas, and apples for a period of one week after their ripening stage. If the communities only consume local food, they would be unable to get it quickly and a significant portion of it would be squandered. Hence, it is essential to distribute the produce to other regions, not only to mitigate wastage but also to facilitate the commerce of the whole harvest. 

In summary, I believe that food should not be only eaten by local residents, but rather supplied to other regions that need it in order to minimise waste and enhance enterprises' profitability. Furthermore, everybody around the globe would be granted universal access to all Vitamins

#rates

#people
#measures","In some nations, despite the decreasing rates of serious crimes, people tend to feel less secure compared to the past. The most obvious causes are previously committed crimes and the detailed description of such criminal scenes on the news, and the most viable solutions are more safety measures in place and detail of any serious case should be banned on the news.

Sometimes, previously committed crimes make people feel less protected. This is because they still have memories of criminal cases and how they happened in the past. As a result, they tend to feel insecure whenever a stranger's presence exists. Moreover, watching the news which contains detailed cruel acts of criminals also leads to unsafe feelings. That is to say, If television and other types of news media visualize the scene of serious crimes too realistically, it will potentially result in destructive mental health, making people afraid of going outdoors and worried about what terrible situation could happen to them. For example, many studies indicate that several individuals are tendentially anxious about going outside after witnessing news of serial murders.

A possible solution to this issue is putting more safety measures in place in order to help people to feel safer. This gives people a sense of security and a way to protect themselves as well as seek help when they are in danger. Another viable solution is regulating and filtering the information published in news media. Specifically, choosing what viewers should see helps people not meet detrimental information about serious criminal cases that potentially lead to damage to mental health. In many nations, the government orders control of details in murders in order to avoid negative effects on national people.

In conclusion, previously committed crimes and detailed news on any serious crimes can lead to people feeling less safe. However, this can simply be prevented by putting extra safety measures in place and compelling news channels to stop showing comprehensive details of dangerous crimes.

Some societies have a notion that experiments on animals should be halted, while others contend that it is important to emphasize the contributions which these trials have to science. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will delve into the ways for regulations and possible alternatives, and provide a logical conclusion. 

First and foremost, the cruelty of human beings is undeniable and it can indicate its effects on many landscapes. Thus, there is no doubt that scholars do a plethora of experiments and try to find a way to stave off grave illnesses, reducing the risk of potential threats, increasing the levels of well-being among individuals, and  creating a more peaceful and soothing atmosphere within societies. However, even if they attempt to enhance the life quality of humans, their activities can directly affect animals which are the bedrock of the whole ecosystem. 

Turning to the methods to protect the habitats, the adjustments are manifold to preclude the detrimental actions which they can be faced with. Initially, the executive powers should take some measures to raise the awareness among public, promoting to buying of vegan products instead of other cosmetics and pharmaceuticals which are tested on animals. Additionally, if specific animal species have some similarities to people, for example, in terms of skin texture, there should be some creatures or plants which are similar to them. Therefore, science needs more time to work on this problem and has to find some other modes. 

In conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this tendency, it is evident that societies should be highly cognizant of the products  they buy to mitigate the number of tests on animals. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts, alleviating its dire ramifications while harnessing the benefits of scientific experiments.

On the one side,it is widely believed by some that museums should become entertainment places as it can be beneficial for both the museum and individuals as well.Firstly,if the museums serve as an entertainment centre,it can attract many people to there.Consequently, people can obtain more income,which can be advantageous for the economy of the country.For example,there are many museums in the United States which serve as an enjoyable place and more and more visitors come there for entertainment and increased revenue can be procured.Secondly,it is also can be beneficial for individuals as it can learn about artefacts and other historical objects in a more effective way.As going to museums may be boring for residents,turning them into enjoying places can attract many people to go the museums for learning .By learning about these objects in an amusing way ,the community can be aware of history without feeling bored.

On the other hand,I would side with those who believe that the main purpose of museums is to inform people,not to amuse them.I believe that  museums should enrich the knowledge of visitors and give accurate information about the  history of  artefacts or other historical objects.In this case,people can gain accurate knowledge about these objects and can appreciate the importance of them ,which can lead to a more educated society. 

Taking everything into account,the question of whether  museums should serve as  amusement centres or educational institutions has valid points on both sides.However,it seems to me that their main aim should be to inform the population so they can acknowledge the importance of their history as well as broaden their knowledge.

As far as I am concerned, I completely agree with this point of view. This essay will discuss both sides, thoroughly.  

   To commence with the negative effects. First and foremost, environmental problems include air pollution, lack of water, deforestation and others. It leads to an international complication. Neither each city nor individual persons is able to tackle  these issues. This is because as I mentioned above, it is becoming a global  problem day by day. Apart from that, for the being time, almost all of the countries are cutting the trees for making various furniture or for  construction or for  other purposes. Therefore, there are not enough trees in order to provide  oxygen. Then, it will cause  air pollution. Furthermore, people use water for unnecessary things or tasks  these days. For instance, local people utilize water for agriculture more than they require. So, it leads to a lack of water.

   On the one hand, there are some positive impacts on the population. First of all,  driving cars cause  air pollution. If they do not drive their own cars, they should use the public transport. However, there are some difficulties that they have to cope with. For example, having not enough seats, overcrowding, noise or others. Not only driving vehicles are causing  air pollution, but  factories  and industrial companies have a negative influence too. But in some countries, the government cannot ban these companies. If they do, there will be unemployment. Thus, the government is not able to forbid it. Not only for the country  but also for the population of this country. 

   By  way of conclusion, I once again restate my position creating more environmental troubles is making  life around the world more complicated.

I would like to start by writing about the advantages of this idea. First of all, students who are in favour of this idea believe that by taking a gap year before going to university they would be able to find a job during this period which gives them significant hands-on experiences that might help them with their future careers. Moreover, they can save up some money that can be used for their upcoming education. In addition, they can use this period to hang out more with their friends and families or for example, spend their time travelling. Those kinds of activities will give them enough social skills and insight about life and other opportunities as a result, they can make better and more practical decisions.

On the other hand, opponents might claim that if students get away from studying and occupy themselves with working and other aspects of life, there is less possibility of going back to school and completing their qualifications. As a result, they will have fewer working options and less chance to get a promotion. Therefore, their life satisfaction will decrease dramatically. Meanwhile, not all the students do something productive during this gap.

To conclude, based on what is discussed above, there are obvious benefits and drawbacks to delaying going to university. In my opinion, schools should provide enough information for students to guide them and students should make their decisions eventually based on the aim of their life.

It is completely agreed that  the lack of physical exercise and eating unhealthy diets is the main reason for obesity. This essay will discuss both causes and solutions before constructing an inference.

One cause of obesity is the excess eating habits of junk food from the markets, which contains more energy and fats. Another factor is the  lack of physical exercise, teenagers after school come at home and play video games and watch television. They spend all their time sitting at home in front of screens, which affects  their brain and health. For example, recently a  report printed from the Blacktown Hospital, New South Wales, 25% of students are suffering from obesity and anxiety. As a result, it is evident that undergraduates do not  listen to their parents and get fat.

The best solution is  physical activities, such as sports and swimming. Parents should send their tutees to play games and do physical exercises. In addition, make a timetable, so pupils can follow that table and perform tasks accordingly.Moreover, add a healthy diet to their daily routine food. Furthermore, take them for picnics and hiking once  a month, so they can physically fit and mix with other peers. For instance, Elon Musk, confirmed in an interview that  his children are following a strict timetable. As a consequence, it is apparent why his family is so healthy.

In conclusion, following the analysis of causes and solutions, it is clear that teachers and parents should put hard rules and regulations on sophomores, so they  can get rid of obesity and live a happy life. Further, it is predicted that this development will continue in the future as well if we do not take quick action.

To begin with, every living beings are a part of  nature. If animal species are exposed to  extinction, our lives will not be the same as it was in the past because all humans and animals are connected to each other, and there is a chain between them. If one chain breaks, it will result in the end of the whole chain. While it is true that it is a tough task to interfere with the issue of  nature, however, technology has created conducive conditions to preserve the animal species from extinction in some cases. To safeguard the animals, we will guarantee our future. 

On the other hand, some animal species are really a threat to the presence of people. And there is no reason for people to preserve them because otherwise, it may result in the death of people. Additionally, some natural processes are indeed inevitable, so people cannot deal with the maintenance of animals, and it requires a lot of effort which people cannot tackle. For example, in the past dinosaurs were killed by the explosion of a huge asteroid, and in this situation, people would not take precautions to save dinosaurs from dying. 

To sum up, the extinction of animal species is done by the mother nature. Whereas it is true that people should preserve them because every living being is an inherent part of  nature, in some cases, it is not practical to save them because they are maybe so dangerous and it can require working hard.

Companies are responsible only for making money for their investors. Therefore, they should not be held accountable for the environmental and social costs of their business activity to society as a whole. Businesses should do no more than concentrate on making profit.

However, a key question is whether they should take into account the environmental and social issues including profit. I personally believe the environment and society are more important than the money that companies earn.

To begin with, companies while making money with the help of their shareholders,  produce environmental problems. What I mean by this is that manufacturers have been appearing more and more every day and their productions are making their budget  grow without considering their harm to  nature. By way of example, it can be brought such industries as car manufacturers, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron which have been polluting the air since their early years. 

Moreover, corporations are forgetting their social responsibility due to brand image and sustainable wealth. In other words, their innovations are for rich people to whom they can sell their goods costly. Medical treatment equipment and cures can be a perfect example.

On the other hand, firms are created exactly to feed employees and employers. Investors of these companies want to be famous, and wealthy as well as to have a worldwide brand image. Therefore, they try to ignore environmental and social welfare, due to these issues turning up as long-term detriments. Thus, supporting these organizations can be right because their earned money might be spent on improving work-life balance. 

To sum up, it is true that enterprises are in charge of enhancing their financial status in spite of their influence on nature and people. In my point of view, environmental and social accountability should be prioritized no matter the target of corporations.

#development","It is evident that progressing technology has had a significant role in facilitating the process of downloading suites or books from the internet for free. There remains some disagreement as to whether it should be considered as an approving or disapproving development. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that implementing this policy would be accompanied by human advancements and environmental improvements. The reasons for this are as follows.

First and foremost, inadequate salaries and unaffordable expenses of life, particularly in developing countries have forced individuals to seek copyrighted music and books. According to the statistics, due to an increase in the price of paper in 2022, the cost of printed books has soared by up to 30% from 2022 to 2023. Thus, rather than spending a fortune on purchasing books , especially for school and university students, downloading them from the internet seems more logical.

Yet, perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this issue is the fact that downloading copyrighted books and music could be accounted as an environmentally friendly move. For instance, in 2023 availability of more books on the internet resulted in a 10% decrease in cut down
 trees. Otherwise, having utilized  timbers in order to produce paper would lead to irreparable ecological consequences. Admittedly, supporting the producers financially by governments and taking measures to prevent any abuse by the police could play a significant role in continuing this trend.

By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that downloading suites or books from the internet for free could have a significant role in the betterment of both society and the environment.

Shifting towards views of agreement,if everything becomes computer accessible then it will affect a lot in the employment sector.To elaborate ,if machines take over stuff ,in addition without money they provide articles then people start preferring them and no job opportunity will be left.For instance,one newspaper company provides occupation to thousands of employees and if they shut down so many folk lost jobs.As a result,unemployment.

#increases
#goods
#country
#transport","Nowadays, the industry plays an important role, and this is shown by the increase in global goods being exported to other countries, which includes long-distance transport to make deliveries. This situation has more advantages than disadvantages.

Firstly, the increased economy of local traders is a result of increased global trade, which allows for market expansion. Producers can sell their products not only in the local market but also internationally, thus increasing potential income and economic growth. As an illustration, local traders in Indonesia who produce charcoal export it to other countries in large quantities. This can lead to job creation and economic improvement in the exporting country.

On the other hand, the community and the environment will feel the adverse impacts. Environmental impact and carbon footprint: One major drawback is the environmental impact of long-distance transport. Shipping goods internationally usually involves significant carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. The use of fossil fuels in shipping and aviation for transport exacerbates the environmental damage. For example, recent studies have shown that in one year, one large container ship can emit cancer- and asthma-causing pollutants equivalent to 50 million cars. And 
furthermore, the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO) released a report in 2007 saying that a 10% reduction in fuel combustion is possible on existing ships and 30–40% is possible on new ships, yet these technologies are largely untapped, as the regulations are largely voluntary. 

In summary, I strongly believe that long-distance transport involving significant carbon emissions may not bode well for society, as it will have long-term effects on people and the environment and may cause serious problems for a country.

Therefore, people are focused on price the most despite the qualities and materials of the product. In my point of view, I agree with this statement and I will demonstrate the reasons why the crowds consider the price rather than other features and measurements. 

To begin with, similar products are sold at distinct prices in the market is common and ubiquitous nowadays. Because there are many manufacturers and service providers that offer identical products and services to their customers. One of the ways to survive in the competition is to manipulate the customer by providing reasonable quotations. That is why people tend to choose services and products based on how much they will pay for them. For example, according to a recent study, the vast majority of customers who receive medical services from various medical institutions have voted they choose cheaper ones.

Secondly, another reason why prices are presented differently is that there are many middle entrepreneurs who buy products from suppliers and then sell them to end-users by adding some profits. Moreover, the prices are calculated depending on how much margin is added to the cost. Therefore, it is better to compare features and prices when you purchase something. 

To conclude, despite the other features and measurements, price is considered a key aspect that affects people’s purchasing behaviors
 and attitudes because of intermediary sellers in the market and competition between producers.

#message","In particular societies, it is commonly said by the elderly that the harder we try, the more successful we are. This phrase is normally expressed to motivate the younger generation to work harder. Nevertheless, this expression is not simply applicable in real life. There are several consideration factors that determine its actualization in reality, moreover, advising children this message is also followed by certain benefits and drawbacks.

Supporting children is invariably a virtuous action; it not only elevates their zeal but also caters to their emotional necessity, ensuring they are adequately backed by their families. Working towards a certain goal necessitates unwavering perseverance, and constant determination renders their aim more achievable. Nevertheless, from my perspective, it is crucial to realise one’s potential as some individuals now are enduring the consequent pressure of coercion to adapt to something that does not align with their genuine ability. 

By way of illustration, considerable evidence indicates that several students opt for engineering majors, motivated by the prospect of higher salaries, despite their deficiency in relevant talent. They hold the view that making a decision of this sort is entirely tenable, provided they dedicate themselves to rigorous academic efforts. This situation could be detrimental for certain individuals, as in some cases they are barely capable of producing satisfactory outcomes. This scenario would be completely reversed if only they followed their true flair. Achieving outstanding accomplishment is exceedingly straightforward, or even effortless. 

Ultimately, advising and encouraging our descendants to succeed is commendable, as it boosts their enthusiasm. Nonetheless, it is beneficial to help them discover their aptitude and allow them to engage with it, without forcing them to veer off course, as it leads to adverse consequences.

It is probably advisable that governments should spend more money on a recycling system to reduce the bad effects of every kind of rubbish on the Earth. The significant amount of garbage produced by people is a striking threat to our planet.  Additionally, authorities must do some extended and urgent research on purifying air and water which are basic needs of every creature. The companies' residue is destroying the quality of both air and water. Without these two determinants, no more creatures will exist in the future.

There is ample evidence that with this huge damage done on the Planet Earth, in the near future, there will be no way to live on it.

A firm stated that they are willing to construct a huge one in our vicinity. There are some advantages like availability and cost-effectiveness along with minor disadvantages such as pollution and crowd in this regard that existing of the factory nearby outdo lack of it.

On the one hand, governments are seriously attempting to construct  new factories and some of them can be built near  residential areas like the one that has already been announced which can have some side effects. Basically, there should be some procedures in states restricting these kinds of actions and rather building them at a certain distance from the residential areas due to their possible pollution in the future which can harm people. Moreover, it is not considered to be well-designed or constructed for the sight of tourists in the case of existing factories inside the urban or rural areas and they may blame the authorities for such an action.

On the other hand, from the industry point of view,  factory proliferation throughout the countries is considered highly positive in terms of industrialization. Absolutely, these amenities help states to produce revenue and use it for the countries' infrastructures therefore, it does not matter if they are located next to civil areas unless it has some harm to the people nearby such as Lead factories in some places.

There are some popular effects resulting from people having bad sleep nights. The first of these are mental problems, such as difficulty concentrating and memory loss. This is because the brain cannot rest properly during the night and, as a result, some brain functions may be affected. For example, recent studies have shown that children with difficulties sleeping might not develop well at school since their brains cannot retain all the information they are exposed to. Additionally, people with sleep problems often complain about irritability and impatience. This is because when the brain is not fully rested, individuals might experience emotion variations.

However, some actions might improve the quality of sleep. Firstly, doctors recommend to avoid using electronics during the evening, especially one hour before bedtime. The reason for this is that the human brain might get confused about whether it is time to be awake or to sleep, due to the devices' blue light. For instance, people with a lack of sleep often report that they watch TV or use their phones in bed right before they fall asleep and, consequently, they often have insomnia issues. Moreover, setting up a night routine usually helps minimize one having difficulties falling asleep. This is due to the human brain getting used to when it is time to sleep by doing the same activities every night.

In conclusion, the main issues from not getting the ideal amount of sleep are dysfunctional brain activities, such as lack of concentration and memory loss, as well as emotional instability. The good practices to mitigate this problem are to avoid the use of screen devices in the evening and to set a night routine.

However, many are concerned about the potential harm of e-cigarettes and their role in leading people to become smokers. While it might be true that vaping is less dangerous than smoking, I believe the substances in e-cigarettes are proven to be harmful and addictive and should be regulated more strictly.

On the one hand, some people argue that vaping is a safer option than smoking traditional cigarettes. They emphasise that it eliminates all the harmful substances resulting from tobacco combustion. In addition, supporters also say that e-cigarettes provide a means for smokers to stop smoking. They believe that since vaping offers the possibility to decrease the nicotine you consume gradually, it makes quitting easier. For instance, in some countries like the UK or New Zealand, e-cigarettes are promoted as an important treatment option for smokers who want to quit.

However, critics claim that while vaping eliminates some harmful chemicals, e-cigarettes still contain addictive or dangerous substances such as nicotine or flavouring chemicals. Moreover, e-cigarettes are known to cause nicotine addiction among non-smokers, which may lead them to take up smoking. Many people who have never smoked are attracted to vaping by the aggressive marketing campaigns and the existence of many different enticing flavours, and many of them progress from e-cigarettes to tobacco. For example, vaping has become very popular among British youngsters, and there is a lot of debate about the need to implement stricter regulations because many of these vapers end up becoming smokers.

In conclusion, although it could be argued that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco and offer a potential alternative for adult smokers trying to quit, the presence of unsafe chemicals and addictive substances in e-liquids is a health risk and leads many non-smokers to start smoking.

#cost
#fuel，to","It is widely known that burning fuel to get energy is extremely harmful to the environment. Carbon dioxide is one of the main gases produced from the combustion of fuel minerals, but also, other toxic substances are released into the atmosphere such as VOCs or Nitrogen oxide. These substances will bitterly damage the ecosystem. It is therefore required to find new ways to produce energy, so the use of these combustibles is reduced. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of increasing the costs of fuel with the intention of reducing its use.

The main point is that governments must find solutions to the increase in pollution in the major cities. They have to make interventions so that climate change is tackled. One of the measures that the G8 organisation has explored is the increase in the costs of fuel. The theory behind this idea is that if the cost of the fuel is increased, the use would be reduced. However, studies have shown that even increasing the cost in the last years, the use of these sources of energy keeps rising.

Our representatives will have to come up with new innovations to reduce the contamination levels. Scientists are our main hope. New energy sources have to be developed before the use of petrol can be downscaled. In addition, more investment must be dedicated to the investigation and development of alternative energies. 

Summarising, fuel is one of the main sources of energy used nowadays. However, research has shown that burning petrol generates emissions of toxic gases, that in the long run would have a big impact on the earth’s temperature and on climate change. Although the use of these products has to be reduced, firstly new alternatives have to be implemented so the end user doesn’t have to afford the consequences of poorly managed government strategies.

There are some points related to the statement Like climate changes in these eras and urbanisation in the modern world, then I will discuss both views in detail in upcoming paragraphs

However, it is some issues created by climate changes in the decade which are increasing the elevation of carbon emissions through traffic vehicles on the road. Also, these types of activities affect the plants and increase the temperature of the earth which may cause species to tolerate the higher heat and die. Moreover, the boom in the population is one other problem which is created to load on the land and build many houses in outer space where a lot of trees are cut out for living affecting the environment and animals. For instance, a study by the Habitat Protection Agency has proven that in the past few years, temperature is elevating by one per cent in every era.

Nevertheless, there are some issues to make by development in every country and they invent various types of gadgets and urbanisation is happening very fast because most companies are occupying land to build their models. Furthermore, it leads to people migrating to Metropolis places for jobs and business purposes then they stay in the cities. In the modern world devastating is doing a very large scale in all countries and it develops many problems for the animals and the environment. For example, the public survey has proven that around one thousand acres of soil are devastating every year. 

In conclusion, certain spaces of flora and Fiona are diminishing due to habitat issues, although other believes that only the atmosphere is a major concern. In my opinion, the government could make some laws for control. These types of consequences do not happen in the future.

This has caused a handful of people to carry an opinion that schools should eliminate non-academic subjects like physical education and culinary classes so that students will be able to focus on their essential academic topics instead. In this essay, I will delve into both sides of the coin and provide an explanation as to why I disagree with this statement.

To begin, in the current climate of the job market, it is important to excel in school. With that piece of qualification, there is no doubt that opportunities will come knocking on your door. As such, by eliminating the non-essential subjects, more time could be used to focus on a more complicated subject which requires more practice for example mathematics and physics. Learning could be optimised and will also allow teachers more time to aid weaker students. For example, it is reported by 
that in Sweden, they only have a few subjects for the students to focus on, so as to streamline the time taken to prepare for their examinations. This has resulted in a hundred passing rate in all their examinations and students are all employed even before graduation. 

Although, with the above being said, as important as essential subjects to be, in a holistic point of view, schools also have the duty to relay messages as well as knowledge to their students about physical wellbeing through physical education and dietary wellbeing by means of culinary classes. This will allow learners to also learn about what they doing and putting into their bodies. Also, this will allow students to discover their passion outside of just regurgitating information the entire day. Students who dislike studying will have the opportunity to find an alternate path of their own through these lessons as well. In an example from Norway, students are introduced to a myriad of classes for instance gardening, for students gain a better perspective of life outside of study.

In conclusion, although it is important to excel at school, I disagree with the statement that removing less essential subjects from their curriculum as there are also things to learn for learners holistically. Classes like physical education will instil the importance of keeping healthy and as we all know, health is the greatest wealth.

#work","In our contemporary society, the phenomenon of academic pressure has long been a subject of controversial debate. Some societies have a notion that there is no need for non-academic subjects,
 and that they should be ousted from the academic schedule, while I cannot agree with this idea wholeheartedly. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will elucidate this issue and offer a logical conclusion from my standpoint.

 

First and foremost, proponents who support the idea of eliminating  the subjects which require creative skills instead of academic knowledge contend that students will not need them in their future lives. To exemplify, students who have different hobbies always attempt to find a way to satisfy their own interests, and in the long run, they will start to ignore their academic accomplishments and tend to be involved in practical activities. Furthermore, there is no doubt that their tendency to participate in vocational practices may result in the decreasing amount of time allocated to their education. 

Turning to the other side of the paradigm, it is important to emphasise the significance of the subjects which can enhance the physical and mental well-being of individuals and can be helpful, in terms of developing lasting skills. For instance, if a person has a predisposition to cookery, they can constantly hone their skills to do their best, and it can give them a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment. Moreover, these subjects may have boons such as paving the way for doing something outside of the academic concept, diminishing the high levels of stress, and creating a more calming and soothing emotional status. 

In conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this thought, while some people allege that it is salient to remove the subjects which are related to physical activity and innovative skills to create  room for concentration on academic life, I do not concur with this way of thinking. I am a staunch believer that we should find a delicate balance between pursuing academic subjects and our own penchant while mitigating the dire ramifications of both stressful and  unsuccessful lives.

On the one hand, automatic household products can provide many aspects for working adults or housewives such as saving time. For instance, my city has dozens of adult employees who spend a long time at work or studying. Therefore, these products such as wash-dishing, kettles and multi-rice-cookers, just press some buttons and can promote a wide range of automatic tasks accordingly. In addition, Hong Kong is a fast-paced city, if machines perform their function significantly by hand, this can benefit workers not spend much time and they can go to work on time. Thus, machines are more likely to have positive performances for mankind.

On the other hand, one of the major disadvantages is frequent maintenance. To illustrate, for example, some machines like washing appliances, seem to have many problems when machines are met in the highest humidity, around over 70%, these probably do not run accurately because some engines are more difficult to work in the wet weather. Hence, this tends to monitor them accordingly and waste money and time checking them.

In conclusion, following the statement above, I believe that automatic products tend to have pros and cons. However, in the contemporary world, the products can bring out many benefits rather than drawbacks as artificially intelligent appliances are more likely to fix maintenance issues.

#support","In this competitive society, there has been considerable debate on whether independent studying is of paramount importance. In my opinion, I go along with this learning method, and in this essay, I will support my belief with detailed explanations and specific examples.

Firstly, self-study reinforces classroom knowledge and improves retention. When students review and practice what they have learned in class through self-study, it helps solidify their understanding and improves long-term retention. By revisiting concepts independently, students can identify areas of weakness and address them before exams or assessments. For example, a student studying history can use self-study to create flashcards, summarize key events, or engage in online quizzes to reinforce their understanding of historical facts and concepts. This active engagement with the material enhances learning and leads to better academic performance.

Secondly, it is undeniable that self-studying pupils can collect experiences as a result of self-research. A survey at Oxford University has revealed that students who apply independent studying methods are more supportive, responsible and collaborative than those who do not opt for it. In addition to this, self-study might be a better approach to specific students than traditional education.

In conclusion, self-study is indeed crucial for secondary school students. It promotes independence, allows for the exploration of personal interests, and reinforces classroom knowledge. By engaging in self-study, students develop important skills that will benefit them in higher education and beyond. Based on those reasons, I firmly believe that independence in studying plays a crucial role in students' knowledge retention.

To commence with views of agreement, giving them extreme penalties will set examples for others.To explicate it,people with get scared before thinking of doing anything against the law.So individuals think that it will decrease the rates of crimes.

Shifting towards views of disagreement, every person deserves a chance, giving them a death warrant only is not a good way to improve things.To elaborate ,sometimes there are circumstances in which individuals have no options in defence they try to do something ,accident happens.For example, there was an incident that happened  back in 1990 in America when a wife killed her husband.They got married for 2 years but her husband was very abusive,he used to physically abuse her every day but on that day he tried to kill her 1-year-old daughter and she was trying to save her but accidentally her husband got killed.Hence,people are not born criminals,sometimes situations make them and it's the court's responsibility to keep an eye on every aspect.

Further strengthening views penalizing certain times  is not fair.To explicate ,giving them that strict life for unlawful acts like stealing a food or wallet is not considerable.People who are under [overty lines and have no money or work so for filling their stomach they do small crimes.Moreover,in some cases individuals who are innocent get caught and lawyers are unable to prove innocence in that case also it would be unfair to do that . For instance,currently case named McCarthy is highlighted in the media due to wrong judgement made by the Judge.After 8 years it was found that the person who was declared guilty was not the criminal,his friend did the accident but McCarthy was found the criminal due to negligence of proof collected by the police and the judge gave 20 years in prison to him but now they found the actual offender.However, the guiltless person had to pay off.As a result,it is immoral as the magistrate is also a human being,sometimes he can also make mistakes.

Even someone hesitates to discuss this subject. I agree with this statement and I will demonstrate why psychological disease is invisible and why people feel disabled when they get sick in mind.  

Some experts agree that mental illnesses are hard to define by initial observation which is why people could not recognise whether they or their loved ones are sick mentally. Because the study of psychology is pretty new in the industry and has just been studied for the past few decades compared to other medical research. In order to diagnose it, patients have to complete tens of questions and should talk with their doctors for hours. Even though they are diagnosed as sick, in appearance, they look like a normal individual due to the fact that they just feel pain inside which is invisible and unfeelable by others. 

As mentioned earlier, crowds may not look at this illness as a visible disease, but individuals who experienced it, feel pain a lot as same as an injury. Therefore, such patients should be considered as disabled as they are unable to work and study or even live as much as ordinary people. For example, people sick mentally tend to isolate themselves from their friends and family and be incapable of making decisions and feeding themselves. As such, a significant amount of support, care, and time are needed for treatment.

To conclude, however, psychological diseases are not considered illnesses in the body such as injury and heart attack, the consequences of this must be accepted as harmful diseases within the community as it is new and hard to identify at first glance.

#trend","Nowadays, fresh produce such as vegetables and fruits are frequently transported over vast distances from rural areas to urban centres before reaching consumers. This practice remains a subject of debate. In this essay, I will delineate several rationales behind this phenomenon and provide my perspective.

Primarily, rural areas offer optimal conditions for cultivating vegetables and fruits, boasting ample open land and favourable natural environments. Additionally, certain regions specialize in crop cultivation, benefiting from specific climatic conditions conducive to large-scale fruit agriculture. For instance, locales like Da Lat and Sapa are renowned for strawberries and cherries, while hot regions excel in watermelon and durian production. Conversely, urban cultivation faces challenges due to high construction density and air pollution resulting from significant CO2 emissions from various activities like transportation and manufacturing. Although techniques such as vertical farming have been adopted in some urban settings, their output remains insufficient to meet market demands.

Transporting fresh produce over thousands of miles from rural farms to urban markets presents challenges in maintaining product quality, particularly in adverse weather conditions or on rough terrain. Vibrations during transportation can lead to bruising of vegetables, while delays may cause spoilage or contamination of fruits. Nonetheless, to ensure adequate quantities and high-quality products, this transportation trend must persist. Integration of freezing equipment in transport vehicles can effectively preserve freshness and minimize adverse effects during transit.

In conclusion, while long-distance transportation of fresh produce entails challenges such as weather and road conditions, it remains the most viable means for urban consumers to access quality vegetables and fruits. The fertile soil, clean air, and expansive agricultural lands available in rural areas support this practice, making it indispensable for meeting urban dietary needs.

Some argue that physical exercise plays a pivotal role in attaining victory matches. However, it seems to me that substantial power is also a crucial condition for performing well in this field. The following article will clarify both viewpoints.

On the one hand, those who claim that muscle strength is an indispensable element of attainment in sports are justifiable in many aspects. To commence with, individuals who are more prone to the wellness of muscular and sturdy bones will lean towards the champion in the competition. The fitter an athlete is, the better chance he stands of winning which is proven in such sports as boxing and waist lifting. Additionally, the team with physically agile, and the individual's endurance gains more advantages over the others. As a result, football players and athletics athletes spend a plethora of relentless training time before the match starts.

On the other hand, opinions argue that sportspersons cannot reach the desirable achievement without mental health. Having a confident state during the games will reinforce their beliefs in themselves so that they can make precise decisions in emergency cases and keep calm regardless of pressures before competitors, especially in football and boxing. For another sport like GOFL, composure and intense concentration are a must. These statuses allowed sportspeople to concentrate better, limit mistakes, and make wise decisions.

In conclusion, I would argue that both mental and physical strength are vital for players to win a competition. These things ought to be balanced to succeed in sports.

There are multiple factors that might drive them to make such decisions, which I believe could be detrimental. In this essay, I will focus on the reasons of
 this phenomenon before moving on to its effects on both sides.

Such beauty chasers might have two primary reasons for making changes to their looks. First off, they may lack confidence in their appearance. For example, it is common for some beauty lovers to complain about their noses being too big or their eyes being too small, even if they are fine. This mindset may facilitate them in changing those parts. Another possible reason is to simply have a normal life. This mainly means the soldiers who have lost a part in the war. Those who have been tremendously wounded need cosmetic methods to fix their look.

Despite the fact that such surgery may make people happy and confident, it is harmful most of the time. To begin with, patients may suffer from post-surgery side effects. This is because of the unknown long-term effects of some new technologies, which could be irreversible and take years before emerging. Secondly, those operations may empty their pockets and lower their living standards. Clients may endlessly spend hundreds of thousands on fixing and maintaining their faces, having little budget left for basic needs. Having said that, it is true that such surgery may bring a brighter future for patients such as blind people who would like new eyes installed.

In conclusion, the growing number of plastic surgery customers is not a straightforward issue. Perfectionism and medical needs might be the major reasons why people choose to have such operations which may result in sequela and poverty. As far as I am concerned, it is more of a negative tendency than a positive one.

A group of people believe  it is necessary for students to study  nutrition science and way of preparation in the best way, while another group of citizens, consider this point as a waste of time because there are fields that are more essential for studying. I think having a special course for foodstuff is beneficial  for schoolers  owing to growing the number of obese people.

To begin with, food is vital for humankind and they have to consume  at least three meals during a day  these intakes are fuel for our body to live, think and also grow. So it is essential to be aware of ingredients and the impacts that they can have on our hygiene state. Additionally, because of the increase in the use of fast foods and junk meals our communities are struggling with the obesity problem also researchers estimated that in the next decades fat population will double. As a result, I believe it is important to tackle this problem and start to make society aware of the effects that our dishes  have on our buddies. For example, the number of fast food shops has increased  dramatically and nowadays this type of meal is easier to access compared  to the past and because of fair prices and fast delivery ,the customers  of in this industry has risen significantly and they are not aware of horrific features of those foods and unfortunately children are the biggest fan and captured a major percentage of this figure.

On the other hand, there are many  necessary majors for students to endure  and putting extra weight on their studies will make them tired in the long term. Moreover, extra lessons need  money and time and these items will make things more sophisticated.

However, the knowledge of meals is vital and to solve this worrying issue governments can consider this lesson as an extra course and  not think about grades and just have it for public awareness to decrease effects and solve obesity problems before they reach  the peak level of danger.

 In conclusion , our consumption will define our health and efficiency so it is advantageous to know about it. In my opinion, having knowledge about meals is positive and governments can consider extra courses for students to prevent  obesity and clarify  junk cuisine aspects  because it is important and  has to be done to halt other uncontrollable consequences.

#nature","It is arguable that the reason for the crime is an economic background or an individual's nature. In this essay, we will discuss both points of view and diverge into one opinion.

There is an opinion that poverty is strongly related to a criminal. It is evident that the environment affects human beings notably. Economic background is not the only reason that affects individuals, however, it is one of the most reliable features, due to its effectiveness in determining one's environment. People who have negative economic backgrounds tend to reside in low-price areas, which could related to worse morality and higher criminal rates than high-price areas. Thus, economic background could affect one's morality. For instance, there was a TV program in which normal people sneak into the prison, and that show demonstrates the possibility of attendants intending criminals increased drastically.

On the other hand, it is clear that in some cases, the environment does not affect one's criminal, but an individual's personality. We showed a lot of examples that some serial killers had grown up in friendly families. Their possibility of being criminals could be observed from a young age, such as abusing animals or a lack of emotional expression regardless of environment. They could be improved with some education, nevertheless, it is obvious that the cause is not from the economic background.

To sum up, it is clear that a disadvantaged economic background and a person's nature both affect the possibility of crime. Yet, personally, the economic environment could be more related to criminals, due to its effectiveness and frequent access in daily life.

This raises a certain question about its production given that land sources are limited and producing meat demands more area in comparison to crop production. In order to reduce  meat consumption, in this essay, I will explore some solutions and explain the difficulties that would emerge after applying those solutions. The reasons for this are as follows.

First of all, in order to decrease meat consumption due to the limited land sources, it is crucial to inform people of the health risks associated with the overuse of meat. According to the statistics in 2021, 30% of diseases related to high blood cholesterol as well as   high blood pressure are the results of excess meat eating, which is high in fat. So, it seems that cutting down on consumed meat would reduce the number of sufferers from those ailments. Admittedly, showing provoking recipes on TV or social media that substitute soy or other crops like rice or potato for meat while mentioning their benefits could attract meat users to herbal goods, which are both healthy and affordable. 

Unfortunately, these steps would have negative impacts on communities. Having implemented those rules, a high demand for vegetative products is highly likely to occur resulting in a soar in green food costs. Even more importantly, though, would be a soar in overusing marine food like fish or prawns, which would lead to a significant fall in marine resources for upcoming generations and an imbalance of ecosystems.

By way of conclusion, I believe that although taking policies to substitute crops for meat is accompanied by some challenges, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks due to the fact that it demands less land and would return to the growth of human health.

#transport","Bicycles are one of the oldest forms of transportation. Many people argue that the bicycle is an effective mode of transportation while some others believe that these are not reliable. We shall discuss both these views and share my opinion towards the end of this essay.

To begin with, let us discuss the advantages of bicycles. First and foremost, riding a bicycle is proven to be an excellent form of exercise for any age group. Medical experts in all areas of medicine unanimously agree that pedalling every day keeps people healthy and fit. Furthermore, cycling does not produce any toxic emissions or sounds which makes it eco-friendly thereby lessening air and noise pollution. Needless to say, traffic congestion on roads which is a nightmare in the mornings and evenings, especially during weekdays is eliminated to a great extent by the use of bikes. In addition, cycles can be bought at a cheaper price compared to four-wheelers and this makes bicycles an affordable option for people with lesser income.

On the other hand, bicycles have some drawbacks too. Bike rides are time- consuming 
which makes them less reliable and convenient. Moreover, it is not suitable for families who like to travel together. For instance, when someone goes on a family trip, four-wheelers are the best option. Similarly, bicycles are not a reliable choice for long-distance travel because it would make the passengers feel tired. In addition, for older people with chronic diseases, bicycles are not a very good transportation methodology.

Taking into account the pros and cons of bicycles, these are undoubtedly a great means of transport, and every citizen of a country should utilize this transport to build a healthy nation. However, it is up to each individual to make a choice whether to use it or not.

#money","One of the widely discussed topics in the contemporary world is that the subject of financial literacy should be included in school education programs. Personally, I tend to believe that these lessons would assist students to enhance their financial abilities, which will be useful in the future and broaden their horizons. 

To commence with, the overwhelming majority of students are financially dependent on their parents, therefore they do not pay attention to their incomes and outcomes. In the future these individuals face problems with controlling their money, as a result, they are likely to be left without cash. Moreover, if people were educated from a young age about finances, and how to leverage them mindfully, they would have a financially stable life. To take one example, a recent government survey found that 58% of poor people are suffering from the fact that their outcomes are more than their profits. Due to the fact that they do not distribute money properly and do not have financial literacy.

Additionally, financial literacy is crucial as well as other STEM subjects, since it plays an essential role in everyday life. By learning about the benefits of properly allocating money students can effortlessly acquire new knowledge. Furthermore, individuals could obtain some skills regarding the usage of money, because maturely leveraging can help prevent future issues. For instance, according to the UK's national research, graduates who were performing great in financial literacy subject had successful adult lives, in comparison with students who were not taught financial literacy.

To conclude, children should be taught about money and overall finances from a young age, since it has an impact on personal development and future mature life.

This financial illiteracy is primarily associated with a lack of both hands-on and theoretical knowledge in schools as well as first-hand information about finance . However , satisfactory education and proper parenting style could tackle this problem .

The reasons why juveniles are incompetent in managing their own money are mainly related to the devoid of both practical and theoretical education. As personal finance is not part of the school curriculum , individuals could experience some difficulties in controlling their budget wisely. Moreover , some  parents do not share certain financial responsibilities with their children; therefore , youngsters lack hands-on experience in their lives. For instance , some parents have not given financial accountability and pocket money  to their offspring in consequence , they do not how to manage their budget and plan for saving in the future.

I believe that problems have to be tackled on a number of levels .Firstly , financial education  comprises basic information which enables individuals how to manage their budget and give responsibility  for making informed  and efficient decisions . If the schools incorporate personal finance  into the school curriculum , students will get rudimentary knowledge , such as how to manage a budget , use credit cards and avoid debt. Similarly , parents should take responsibility by instilling  financial independence in   children. To illustrate , according to investigations individuals whose parents gave them the freedom to make a budget  are more confident in terms of spending money and planning personal budgets in comparison with others.

 should be allowed to get the personal details of employees or not has sparked controversial opinions, with advocates and critics both representing valid arguments. This essay will analyze both perspectives and will subsequently offer a viewpoint.

To begin with, the primary reason that the collection of personal details of employees such as their hobbies, and interests should be acceptable is because it helps the employer to understand the nature and skills of personnel easily. There might be some individuals who might be good sports personalities, this depicts that they may inherit excellent cooperation and coordination skills. Moreover, schedules can be amended as per the needs of people who are married because they have a family to take care of and spend some quality time with them. Thus, if the company knows that they are married then they can be shifted to the nearest office.

On the flip side, some owners may judge their workers according to the hobbies, and interests they have. This is not an accurate way of judging people. For instance, there are a certain number of adult workers who prefer to drink during the night, and if their owners and co-workers know about that they may judge them inappropriately. Furthermore, some married women can be dominated at work because individuals may think that due to their family pressure, they will not be able to concentrate. Superiors will not give equal importance to married women and single ladies.

According to my viewpoint, judging people through their interests is not relevant. Instead, everyone should be provided equal opportunities to prove their skills and qualifications.

To conclude, as per the matrimonials mentioned above, disclosing personal interest in front of the employer has both merits and demerits but in my opinion, it is not useful for the employees to give their details while joining the firms.

There are two main reasons why true-crime TV series and books are increasing in popularity these days. Firstly, they usually provide exciting storytelling and unexpected plots. This is because the narrative often involves solving mysteries and, therefore, watchers feel intrigued to know the turn of events. For instance, Dexter's TV show had a huge audience throughout many seasons, due to its interesting plot and excellent casting. Additionally, watchers often feel more motivated to consume crime stories that were inspired by real crimes. This may be due to their curiosity regarding what has happened and, sometimes, after the shock of discovering that the story is real.

From my perspective, I do not think this genre is good for people's mental health. The reason for this is that it may have a negative psychological effect on watchers' minds. Since many stories are based on real life, individuals can feel shocked and mentally ill after seeing violent and bloody scenes. For example, the recent TV series called The Bear has received many reviews saying that people felt too horrified from watching scenes which made them feel uncomfortable and sometimes depressed. Moreover, consuming too many crime stories may affect individuals' confidence to go out of their homes and attend to their daily routines. This may be due to them losing trust in others since anyone could be a psychopath or a serial killer, for example.

In conclusion, the reasons why many people from different countries are interested in consuming crime stories lately is because of the stimulating scriptwriting and the curiosity of knowing how true crimes have happened. However, in my opinion, crime films and novels should be consumed with caution since they may trigger people's psychological traumas and reduce one's trust in others.

 In the following graphs, I will discuss both views and give relevant examples.

 To begin with, technology is changing dramatically and improving all aspects of our lives. Those equipment are upgraded and their skills becoming more advanced, as a result, their ability to work in adult positions is becoming more possible. Some hard and repetitive work such as packing or organizing can simply be done by machines. For example, nowadays the majority of companies (Amazon online shop) use robots for moving products in storage and it is completely beneficial and effortless, additionally, increases productivity and reduces potential risks.

On the other hand, some jobs are sensitive and need human knowledge and also need a sense of feeling and ignoring  individual aid will have catastrophic consequences. For instance, judges and lawyers, these professions need both a keen mind and a deep understanding of evidence and robots or programs can be easily distracted from the main point because those have some order and rules also can not easily adapt to all possibilities. Consequently, I think positions  that can put others ' lives in danger need the involvement of the population to destroy risks.

It is completely agreed working from residence is time-saving and beneficial for the environment. Both sides of this topic will be carefully analysed before constructing an inference.

On the one hand, more screen time and missing face-to-face meetings. The main reason is that when working from  home, staff must be present in front of the screen, which damages our eyes and brain. Another factor is that employees miss all personal interactions, where they get knowledge from their office people.

In addition, less traffic and savings on fuel and travel expenses, such as fewer commuters using public and private transport   as a result,  will reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For instance, the New South Wales environmental department measured the smoke level in the year 2021 and found a clean air level. As a consequence, companies encourage their engineers to work from home , so they can save on office expenses.

In conclusion, following the analysis of both sides, it is clear that working from home is best for mankind and companies, where they can save time and money, however working men and women lose their confidence and knowledge which they get from their mates. Further, it is predicted that this development will continue in the future as well.

It is thought that many countries investing much  money in the art sector is crucial , which may significantly affect a part of well-being improvement and tourism. For instance, In Italy and Paris, there are a plethora of creative activities established such as lots of museums in Paris. As a consequence, those creative art are appealing to tourists across the world as well as remarkably increasing the amount of income in that section. Moreover, this part also contributes to economic growth and capita income. 

Conversely, some people think that the investment in health and education is much better. It is obvious that those improvements are fundamental to the well-being of their populations. There are free campaigns of public schools and hospitals for the citizens which are organized by the government. For example, studying at a university in Germany is free for  citizens. Furthermore, when people are less concerned about the amount of spending on school fees and  medical expenses. They could be more pleased enjoying their lives, which most  people prefer work-life balance.

The main reason for my agreement is domestic tourism is becoming increasingly accessible and appealing. As infrastructure within a country improves and the tourism industry grows, tempting domestic destinations are being developed and promoted. For example, a new high-speed railway in Laos has cut travel times from the capital to the tourist mecca of Luang Prabang down to 3 hours, from a full-day bus journey previously.

In addition to my positive view the cost of travelling domestically is often cheaper than travelling internationally. This is especially true when factors such as exchange rates and airfares are taken into account. With the economy in many countries still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are looking for ways to save money on vacations, and choosing to holiday within their own country is an effective way to do so.

My final supporting argument is the trend towards sustainable tourism is also likely to drive more people towards domestic holidays. Choosing to vacation within one’s own country has a smaller carbon footprint than travelling internationally, and is, therefore, more environmentally friendly. As more people become aware of the importance of sustainability, they are likely to choose domestic holidays over international ones in order to reduce their impact on the environment.

In conclusion, in my view, it is crystal clear that in the future, more people will choose to go on holiday within their own country rather than travelling abroad. With the increasing accessibility and appeal of domestic destinations, the cost savings of domestic travel, and the trend towards sustainable tourism, it is only natural that residents will choose to explore the beauty and attractions within their own borders.

On the one hand, some people justifiably argue that through history lessons, people of all ages can gain valuable life lessons that will strengthen their sense of identity. In other words, from a cultural viewpoint, historical research can provide insight into a better understanding of a society. In other words, learning about historical events can shape our values and beliefs. For example, we can study the past of a developed country and figure out how it has developed and we should follow the example of them.

On the other hand, another group of people claim that the past is gone and can not be changed, so there is no point in dwelling on it. They insist that focusing on historical events can distract us from addressing current issues and challenges. However, I do not find this argument convincing as this knowledge can inform our decision-making processes and help us avoid repeating past errors. For instance, a nation that has been attacked in the past and damaged improves its defence structures and is less likely to be damaged again.

Contemporary technology in teaching is very convenient and time-saving for students as well as for teachers. The primary advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon are discussed in the following passages.

On the one hand, there are various benefits of using new technologies for teaching students. Firstly, through the conventional method, it is very difficult for teachers to explain  complex topics to students. But, after the advent of new audio-visual technology, it is very easy to explain tough topics with the help of animations. Additionally, since most educational institutes have adopted online teaching, students can easily learn from anywhere in the world, which is very convenient and time-saving. 

Despite these advantages, there are many drawbacks of new technologies which not only affect the learning curve of students, but it affects the overall health of pupils. First, it is nearly impossible for teachers to know if students are paying attention while teaching online and as a result, most students can’t score well in exams. Furthermore, new gadgets require pupils to constantly use digital screens which is very harmful for students of all ages. For example, as per a recent study, nearly 50% of children below the age of ten, wear spectacles due to excessive use of digital screens.

In conclusion, new technological advancements in education surely increase students’ ability to grasp  complex subjects, and they are far more convenient and time-saving for teachers and students than traditional methods.

#children
#work
#people","A lot of countries practice the engagement of children in paid work. While some would argue that it is totally inappropriate, others believe that it helps kids obtain some real-life experience. I agree with the latter one because this increases a child's chances of integrating into adult life more smoothly.

On the one hand, yearly-age workers spend their spare time doing something useful and, ultimately, will be rewarded with a salary. This acts as motivation to fulfil their wishes and teaches them that nothing is free; if you want to possess something, then make an effort. For example, a friend of mine is a farmer, and he has a son. The kid wanted a bicycle right away. The father suggested the son help him on a farm with daily duties in exchange for money, which could be spent on anything he wanted. In the end, the bicycle was bought, and the kid was happy. I think it was a great example of upbringing as well.

On the other hand, kids who were employed would be much more prepared for adulthood compared to those who weren't. However, real work experience prepares adolescents for a smoother transition between childhood and upcoming adulthood. Also, the children would be able to value their spare time and would become closer to their parents. As an example, after returning home from a hard work day, they are unlikely to pout after being rebuffed by their mom or dad on the request to buy a toy because they are aware of how challenging it can be. Nevertheless, work should not be harsh and difficult, no matter how valuable experience could be gained.

In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with hiring children and paying them for their jobs; I would even say that it is wrong not to do this.

Others think that if cultural activities are supported, the population and the culture may  benefit. I strongly agree with the after statement because of some major reasons that I shall explain in more detail in this essay.

On one hand, it is believed that  government funding should be invested in helping the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and other people from disadvantaged situations instead of art and culture because they are not essential elements in life. Art and culture are available in the world to those who have a high  quality of  life. Thus art and culture should be pay by private finance. To illustrate, if a rich person wants to get a wealthy artwork, he or she will pay a large amount of money to get it. 

On the other hand, I believe that if the authority invests in cultural activities, it may bring benefits to the president and culture because they are hosted frequently. Moreover, they are very cheap or free for participants. Eventually, there will be more people joining these activities. Not only is it a great opportunity for the population to socialize in a wholesome way, but it also helps a nation  preserve its culture. For instance, in Japan, if females wear kimonos, the traditional clothes of Japan, they will get an amount of money. This motivates the Japanese to wear kimonos and get attention from tourists.

In conclusion, allowing publishing resources on art and culture is not as important as other societal issues, but supporting cultural activities might help people  access them easily

#technology","It is argued that our lives were more fulfilling when technology was less complex. This essay completely disagrees with this statement and believes that computers and the internet have made life much better because smartphones save us time and the internet has improved education. 

New phones, such as the iPhone, have made our daily lives much less laborious and have given us more free time. Jobs that used to require a lot of energy and time can now be done at the touch of a button. For example, if people wanted to communicate with one another in the past, they had to write a letter, take it to the post office, and then wait for it to be delivered, whereas these days people can simply tap the email icon on our touch screen and send a message to whomever they want to communicate with within seconds. 

The internet has also enriched education. In the past, students had to rely on a teacher and physical books for their education, and these were often either unavailable or in a format that most people did not want, but now the internet provides us with more information than we could ever dream of, and this has made us more independent and effective learners. For example, there are now thousands of free online courses available on YouTube that anyone can watch and learn from anywhere in the world.

At first glance, a large percentage of individuals are induced by plenty of developments resulting in the abundance of  ease, besides that, many are able to earn more income in urban since most organizations' headquarters are settled in the city due to the advantages such as the easier access of users. Not forgetting to mention that, each progress is expanded from the urban to rural either industrial or technological. For instance, in some countries, when it comes to transportation, the sky train which can be considered  a high-quality technology owing to numerous merits both for citizens and tourists is solely launched in the city meanwhile folks are using personal cars to commute in the countryside causing costs.

For these reasons, most governments are trying to mitigate as soon as possible, many policies are offered in the council amongst ministers, and some reckon that advertising local brands can solve the troubles because the crowds can reap the income from the interaction, on top of that, some believe that technological developments should be operated not only in urban but also in rural. For example, firstly, the signal can permit the local students to approach the better sources of data and those are able to apply their knowledge in order to make the greatest benefit for the state, undeniably, it is very slow when compared to other realms and ought to be improved concretely.

In conclusion, most folks want to live in the city as a result of several pros which have not happened in the countryside yet, hence, I opine that the distribution of progress seems to be very crucial to persuade individuals.

#people
#waste
#money","Some would argue that authorities spend too much money on artists' support, while others believe that those funds are better spent elsewhere. Both points of view make sense, but I agree with the latter one because art is not the only thing to be focused on.

On the one hand, art undeniably should be funded and supported by the government. Consequently, more and more artists would be able to get a stage and the opportunity to express themselves. New exhibitions would be organized and jobs created, leading to the establishment of extra professional relationships. In addition to that, involvement from the younger generation would also increase. For instance, over the last decade, mostly big Ukrainian cities have taken part in international events dedicated to modern art. Nevertheless, I think that such actions should have been provided in smaller towns as well, helping outlying communities to be closer to this kind of activity.

On the other hand, the investments that have been put into arts could have been spent on something else, like education. In this sector, plenty of areas could be found where additional government attention is required. For example, in small villages in Ukraine, not many school subjects remain due to curriculum reductions enforced by authority rules. Thus, locals have fewer programs, which results in a decrease in the average level of children's intelligence. However, I do believe that spendings have to be balanced out and used precisely, focusing on providing additional study facilities and opportunities.

#society","Growing older is a natural part of our lives. While many people would view this with a pessimistic attitude, others believe that getting old would make life easier in the modern setting. In the following essay, I am going to discuss both views and state my opinion about the matter. 

On one hand, becoming elderly would bring many shortcomings, most notably to people’s well-being. This is due to the fact that, as individuals grow older, their immune system would degrade and thus, senior citizens would become weak and frail, as well as they are more likely to be vulnerable to diseases. Hence they require a lot of attention and need to be treated with care. For example, a mild shift in the weather conditions could result in severe illness among the elderly, and while they can recover after a short while, their health is seriously affected. 

On the other hand, senior citizens could have a happier life by receiving treatment from the young. To put this in a simpler way, the elderly could retire to their houses or a retirement home, both would surround them with the amenities and care needed by nurses and their family members, to ensure that the old could live as comfortably as possible. Taking individuals who would reside in a retirement home as an example, they will be assisted with daily routine by an assigned nurse and their meals, along with their health are strictly supervised so that they can stay away from sickness, while also maintaining a certain level of activeness. 

In conclusion, while many people believe that ageing is certainly a negative thing because of the effects it has on their health, others assume that they could live more easily owing to the care they receive from their families and specialized facilities. In my opinion, I believe while there are certainly some limits to ageing, individuals could enjoy a much simpler life

I would like to start my argument by writing about the importance of the examinations. People who are in favour of this method believe that, after teaching each subject, pupils should be assessed to determine how effective was the course and how much students learn from the subject. They claim that paper-based tests are the best way because,
 all the students will be examined in the same and fair condition. Moreover, high-quality exams consist of different types of questions such as multiple-choice and essay tasks that give test-takers almost enough information about each individual student.

On the contrary, people who oppose this kind of assessment argue that  students have different intellectual capacities and they should not be judged merely by taking paper exams. For instance, some of the students perform much better on group tasks, some have the ability to manage a team, and, some have better research skills. Thus, other types of evaluation techniques should also be considered. For example, group projects to determine teamwork ability or writing an essay to measure independent learning.

To summarize, based on what is mentioned above, in my opinion, the role of  formal pen and paper exams in assessing students' learning is undeniable. But, in addition to that, other forms of evaluations should be applied.

In my opinion, economic instability and governmental advertisements contribute to this situation. I am also convinced that homeowners are more likely to benefit from privacy and economic success. Therefore, the benefits of purchasing a house override its drawbacks.

From my perspective, in some developing countries which face economic recession and high levels of inflation, citizens are compelled to buy a house. This may provide them with economic stability and prevent financial issues in the future. For example, in Iran, the rent and price of properties are escalating alarmingly on a regular basis. Consequently, if people do not take steps towards owning a house, they will never afford it. Moreover, the interest rate of bank loans is increasingly going up and taking a loan can be challenging to some extent. On the other hand, since housing is a primary source of revenue for governments, they encourage people to purchase a house as soon as possible.

I further believe that owning a home is able to lift the burden from households’ shoulders. This enables them to tackle other problems and experience economic prosperity. For instance, they are likely to make ends meet and save money for their children’s education. Additionally, homeowners are able to take full advantage of privacy and calm. This may result in boosting the quality of life and health levels.

In conclusion, the economic stability and the policy of governments convince people to buy a house instead of renting it. Also, I opine that the economic prosperity and privacy which are associated with purchasing a house turn it into a positive notion.

#answers","Ever since industrialization has become the key sector in any country, some people think that taxes should be higher than others because they pollute the environment significantly, while others argue that there is another solution to tackle it. Whilst acknowledging that there are a few solutions other than increasing tax, I think the former idea is more beneficial than the latter ones. 

Environmental contamination is essential in all countries, and the majority of pollution is a result of industrialization. Therefore, some experts advise that the high tax policy can solve the issues. Because they believe that funds collected through taxes would be spent for the rehabilitation of the ecology. This is the most effective way to manage environmental deterioration with full accessibility and control. For example, in some countries, the government agent selects the companies that perform and are responsible for assessing the contamination and cultivation of trees and plants. Such projects are then financed by business owners through taxation.  

On the other hand, it can't be neglected that there are other methods to handle this problem, such as making the companies' operations more eco-friendly and pushing them to improve their technologies. However, this approach may bring certain advantages to companies and countries in the long run, which might take much time, effort, and investment to fulfil all requirements, including technologies, policies, and regulations.  

In conclusion, although there are better ways to deal with industrial pollution, such as involving new technologies and initiatives, imposing a higher financial charge on manufacturers would be the best and fastest approach to collecting and distributing the funds for solving ecological and economic problems to restore and protect nature.

I personally do not agree with this statement because the exploration of space helps us to understand the universe better and allows companies to create a business around it. 

It is believed that spatial trips will allow humans to understand their world and help them to attend to the problems that they face. Moreover, the answers to the Earth’s issues can be found outside its atmosphere so, it is better for us to learn about what is there. For instance, in 2023, a research team from Harvard University analyzed what individuals thought about the 600 spatial discoveries made that year. About 62% of them believed that space missions are necessary due to the fact that such advances will help human societies face their problems correctly.

Researching might help national economies grow thanks to the discoveries made during trips to space. The results of these will present the outside world as an important place to exploit  and will increase the economic situation in countries in a positive way. For example, after the first moon landing by India in 2019, 500 companies were created with the simple idea that the extra-atmospherical world was becoming accessible to them and that they should make money off of it. That illustrates that these missions are good for the progress of the economic state of all societies on Earth. 

To conclude, I think that we should make more explorations in order to become the best race out there and allow economies to grow.

The matter is that people have the same trends and habits in daily life facets like fashion, diet and media. Some might perceive this march negatively due to the loss of the original identity of nations although I presume that  overall, the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages. 

Indisputably, negative consequences naturally appear as more countries share a homogeneous culture and, greater a loss of uniqueness. Take the example of South Korea, which had an essential impact on the United States of America due to  industrialization, and now presents a small amount of folk arts and customs. A similar trend is noticed in Kazakhstan, where the Western concept of individualism turns foreground than traditional values. In addition, it is also exacerbated by lingua franca languages. Society strives to acquire high-level English or Spanish but a mere few of them can boast fluency in their native language.  

Despite the fact that it might sound counterintuitive, the main merit is that the public does not have uphill struggles. Indeed, the fashion industry looks for ethnic style and collaborates it with modern trends. Also because of the popularity of  cinematography, residents detect distinctive features of small local autonomies. Hence, they get a deep insight into behaviours and seem to be tolerant. When it comes to nutrition, it helps deprived ones to get accustomed to a well-balanced diet, as new kinds of greens and fruits show up in regional stores. 

In conclusion, the interconnectedness of countries in cultural aspects is inevitable. Although demerits can not be overlooked in this serious discussion, I believe that in the end pros outweigh all the potential cons as the world is open to every nation and respects its values.

This essay will thoroughly analyze both perspectives before ultimately affirming my agreement with the latter.

It is comprehensible why certain individuals argue that the extinction of specific species of flora and fauna constitutes a pressing environmental issue. The primary justification for this belief is that it can result in the depletion of biodiversity, which is a factor in significant environmental phenomena such as climate change and ecological imbalance. For example, numerous species of animals and plants are currently at risk of extinction, including the saola, Asian elephant, and turtle. Deforestation is a primary factor contributing to the decrease in the number of plants. Given these factors, it is entirely justifiable to believe that the loss of numerous wild species is the primary cause of environmental issues.

Conversely, I align myself with those who argue that there are more significant environmental issues. Primarily, the environmental problems arise from a confluence of multiple factors. Concurrent with the process of modernization and industrialization, individuals have not only achieved remarkable success in their lives but have also had a detrimental impact on the environment. For instance, transportation vehicles emit carbon dioxide, which contributes to the carbon footprint. Additionally, the untreated wastewater discharged by numerous factories poses a threat to human health and aquatic life. All of those issues are pressing and should be addressed promptly to safeguard our living environment.

Ultimately, while there are valid arguments supporting the notion that the depletion of wild species is primarily responsible for environmental problems, I maintain that these issues stem from a multitude of factors.

This essay will conduct a thorough analysis of both perspectives prior to reaching the conclusion that my stance leans towards the latter.

One can comprehend the rationale behind the belief that physicians and engineers ought to be employed in the nation where they completed their educational programs. Possibly the most important justification is that this is an effective method for them to express their appreciation to the country for providing them with an advanced education. For instance, certain high school graduates may be eligible to apply for and receive scholarships from a number of prestigious universities abroad in order to obtain career-related training. Therefore, it seems entirely reasonable to hold the view that these students ought to contribute to the betterment of the country in which they study.

Conversely, I am of the opinion that professionals should be compensated for the opportunity to work in a foreign country if they so choose. The primary reason is that each individual's unique way of reasoning influences their own decisions. For example, after graduating from college, some individuals may wish to reside close to their families or pursue a well-compensated occupation in a metropolitan area; therefore, they would intend to work in the region where they ultimately settle down. They have made a reasonable request that ought to be accorded due respect by others.

In summary, although it is widely held that physicians and engineers ought to be required to work in the field for which they received their education, I hold the firm conviction that their career decisions ought to be contingent upon market demand.

From my perspective, I am inclined to stand neutrally with both aspects since they both considerably influence the future of the world.

Initially,one of the main arguments in favour of environmental conservation is that it needs the world as a whole to work together to protect the Earth. As the Earth has become a village, the environment requires every human to have consciousness to conserve it.Therefore, international cooperation plays an indispensable role in communicating with different countries. For example, the International Emission Agreement set up a rule for the world to follow and has significantly limited  charcoal emissions. Thus,environmental protection indeed is a crucial issue of international cooperation.

At the other end of the spectrum, international cooperation can contribute to a significant effect on business as it is not restricted to a certain area. Take K-pop for instance, the charm of Korean idols has spread around the world.When those super idols host their tour concerts around the world, the business benefits are not only brought to the Korean pop industry but also the local tourism  where the concert is hosted. Hence, the development of world business is an essential proportion of international cooperation which will bring vibrancy to world economics.

To sum up, despite the fact that environmental conservation demands international collaboration, the importance of business potential cannot be ignored. Thus, countries should optimally cooperate so as to generate long-term merits for the world and create a sustainable living environment.

The original cause of this phenomenon is that the budget to run an automatic system, which can be generated by AI has dropped. This is due to the development in the number of AI cooperations, which has led to a decline in the AI price. Based on CNN's surveillance, the cost of owning an AI system has fallen from more than 500 thousand dollars in 2010 to only 50 thousand dollars in 2023. As a result, more companies will have a chance to occupy a better technique in their businesses.

It must be recognized that this is a positive development due to AI and robot efficiency. This is because AI can do its job more precisely than human workers. Additionally, the fee to operate AI processes is much lower than the wage that humans have to pay to human employees. Taking Amazon as a prime example, they have saved about 4 to 5 billion dollars every year just by replacing their staff with robots and their efficacy is maintained at the same level. Therefore, AI can be a solution to reduce the amount of money invested.

Taking everything into account, the reduction in AI costs has turned AI into a substitute for mortal employees. Hence, this is an
 useful development due to its exactness and low operation value.

In light of this, the author contends that this phenomenon takes place due to the increasing demand from the public for life quality and is a beneficial change as it promotes global development. It is vital to understand that the idea of AI development deprives of social requests for a better life. In other words, AI can automatically conduct industrial procedures without any human support. As a natural outcome, the industrial output, including product quantity and quality, will be enhanced and eventually fulfil the rapid growth requirement of the community. Taking VinFast, an electricity car company, as a remarkable instance, since started implementing robots into producing processes. The product distribution has been widened globally. In regard to social impact, it is evident that the promotion of global innovation brings us various positive changes. To be specific, artificial intelligence could get rid of physical limitations better than humans, moreover, robots are extremely supportive in helping scientists solve a number of complex mathematics. As a result, robot existence in the workplace not only tightens time on the contrary also reinforces scientific progress, which can produce more efficiency and global breakthroughs.

While the author assumes that this phenomenon comes from the superior function of automatons that have digitalized the workplace, this alternative will negatively affect people leading a sedentary lifestyle.

It must be acknowledged that precision and persistence in automated appliances have led to human substitution. Specifically, the world’s current orientation is to fully digitalize every Internet-related job, which is equivalent to the fact that there is likely to be no involvement from  humanity. By utilizing the efficiency of the cyber world, each corporation can earn an abundance of profits in their lucrative field, turning it into a more expanded with stronger impacts. This is true in a company called Datalogic, the procedure in manufacturing their digital product has been operated by automobiles since the 4. 0 has paved a better way to seek benefits.

Another point worth mentioning is this phenomenon may result in the public leading a sedentary lifestyle. The fact that appliances such as robots or artificial intelligence will carry on all the projects and strategies,  illustrates a prospect without any human involvement. Consequently,  society's progress earns profits from these future machines, as people enhance their living standards, which eventually leads to a dreadful society that only depends on android machines. Hence, the way automated apparatus and artificial intelligence digitalized people is a concerning problem.

In conclusion, automatic machines and synthesis subtlety are replacing humans due to their superior ability that  bring benefits to a country. Nevertheless, this alternative may result in the masses leading a sedentary lifestyle.

For instance, the Indian Education Department  conducted a survey with grades 5-12 and found that 6 out of 10 students  prefer to study in the library and got more than 85% by self-review just by using library material.  

Secondly,it has multiple resources at a cheap price.To explicate ,in libraries, there are multiple editions and writers' books available for every stream and they can exercise for free in their.Moreover,if they want to take it home they can borrow it and just need to pay an amount of money as a deposit and when it is returned person can  that money back.Additionally,there are various machines presented for photocopying and printing at low prices.However, using online books can affect eyesight.

On the contrary,  others think that it is essential to have the right to make decisions in childhood because of its effects. In my opinion, a child needs  freedom in the way of living and sharing its tastes like another human being in everyday matters.

Children who can make a decision about their needs are more confident. Although parents have to lead and guide them to make a reasonable choice, they should teach youth the importance of having confidence and telling their own ideas instead of being quiet and obedient. If we do not give this opportunity to a child to say her/his opinion, it would make him/her a potential victim of bullying in the near future. For instance, pupils who are more free to say their thoughts about what they want experience less bullying than those who are shy and raised by the method of obeying  parents in order to what they wear or eat. 

Another reason for this mindset is achieving a more democratic and equal society by teaching children to have their own choices in everyday matters. The young generation are the next citizens who can defend their rights in future if they see how they can do it from the early beginning. When they are allowed to be treated as a person respectfully in their preferences and what they want, it can not only improve their sense of identity but also eradicate any possibility of being a deactivated individual. We are witnessing the impact of these little activities in recent changes in political aspects and societies which have been done by recent generations for example [in Iran]. Through this, the world may be obviously healthier and a better place for humankind to live freely with less oppression.

In conclusion, having the Right of choice in childhood about what they want as a hobby, clothes or food is a vital part of nurturing. This is a real protection to defend themselves from bullying in school and also as a civilized person against any dictatorial behaviour or policy

#prioritizes
#growth
#concerns","In many nations, governments put more focus on improving their economies than other sectors. Although residents’ earnings will increase, I personally believe that the prime drawback outweighs the main benefit as this will cause environmental pollution.

One major benefit of prioritizing economic development is that it will solve the unemployment issues and significantly increase the number of employed citizens. That is to say, countries, where their economies are growing, require substantial workforces to produce sufficient supplies of goods in order to meet markets’ demand. As a result, more and more citizens are in employment. Moreover, this will also offer citizens a better quality of life. This is because when economies are growing, governments will gain more taxes from trading and can spend them on welfare, substantially contributing to facility constructions such as hospitals, bridges, and educational infrastructures.

On the other hand, focusing only on economic development results in serious environmental damage. This is totally because manufacturing processes generate CO2 and other detrimental emissions, sewage, and industrial waste which are released into the environment and cause air, water, and soil pollution. Furthermore, industrial pollution will negatively affect people’s health by causing respiratory diseases as well as some types of cancer. Take an example, a recent study concludes that most of the CO2 emissions come from industrial plants, leading to lots of photochemical fog which could be sometimes seen in cities.

In conclusion, while prioritizing economic development will result in an increase in employment and a better quality of citizens’ lives, the serious downsides that come with this are environmental pollution and residents’ health.

Fast-paced advancements are now one of the factors which take the blame for a violation, as many people claim that more and more brutal scenarios in media occur. Although it might sound obvious at first, I vehemently disagree with the statement. Criminal actions are primarily caused by economic and social backgrounds.

To begin with, it is explicable why the majority is used to view video games and films as culprits. Violence treatment and rewarding outcomes of a bad affair might build a wrong concept of the justice system. Especially, youth are easily influenced by these images on television, for instance, a serial Money Heist grabbed the attention of an audience for a prolonged period. All around the world teenagers create idols by following those characters. Also, the game industry is mainly dominated by fighting games, such as Mortal Combat and Tekken, which might spur them to take up experimenting with those tactics  in the real world. 

Despite the fact that rough behaviour is displayed in multimedia, consumers are not stimulated to rob or even commit a homicide. As it was mentioned in the previous paragraph, family environment and financial condition are crucial sources for offenders. Accumulated debts and lack of valid education negatively impact a community. In addition, as researchers present constant physical or sexual abuse in childhood could enhance the percentage of a kid to become an inmate in the future. Hence, it is hard for individuals to break this vicious cycle and avert the criminal world.  

To conclude, it is undoubtful that technology takes an essential role in many fields of our lives. But I believe, that in order to tackle the issue of growth in illegal acts, the government would better focus on anti-poverty projects and provide deprived people with proper education rather than accusing the mass media.

To begin with, plenty of foreign languages are taught at educational institutions since the crowds realise the merits of the interaction both to the country and to the person in this day and age, nevertheless, a fair portion of people opine that the students should be able to learn voluntarily because the embarrassment caused by the mistakes may appear during studying, besides that, some say that it is a time-consuming machine. For instance, in the afternoon, children ought to play outside which is able to boost either physical or mental strength with their friends instead of studying unnecessary lessons which can reduce the courage and mark the wound in mind.

On the contrary, loads of the folks opine that communication is very crucial nowadays because individuals are living in different countries which own each language, furthermore, cultural differences are considered the troubles often happening whilst not only working but living thus the group of people believe that the issues can be eliminated by the school. For example, Japanese is spoken in Japan, and in parallel, Americans speak English, hence, in the case of business communication, the translator is a must. To illustrate further, most Japanese use chopsticks during a meal meanwhile other countries eat with a spoon. For these reasons, it should be taken part by educational institutions.

In conclusion, in my opinion, I believe that although  mistakes often turn up during the subjects, they can also be symbolised as a level of progress, therefore, the students should access and apply the new knowledge in normal life.

While some people believe that mobile phones should be banned in public places such as libraries, shops and public transportation, I would argue that mobile phones are necessary for people's lives. I will explain my reasons in this essay.

There is no doubt that a mobile phone is a tool for helping people's daily lives. This is because telephones can be helpful to people in any situation such as searching for a navigator when they get lost, used for calls in emergencies and for entertainment. For example, when people travel to new places or other countries they can use the online maps on their phone to find out the way to get to the nearest grocery, a restaurant or a hotel. As a result, smartphones can benefit people by quick data when they need any information immediately.

It is worth pointing out that a smartphone is a good assistant in emergency situations. This is based on the fact that people can use this gadget right away when an accident happens in public places such as buses, trains and motorways. For instance, the news in Japan reported that 80% of emergency calls in accidents on  public transportation result in people using smartphones to report can be quick and can be fast to solve problems. Consequently, a mobile phone is a faster way to report any emergency situation.

In conclusion, we can observe that mobile phones can not banned in public places because this gadget is beneficial for human lives. Overall, I firmly disagree with this statement.

#case","It is true that many people worldwide suffer from hunger although  developments have grown in agriculture. There are several reasons for this and government should take some steps to alleviate this problem.

One of the reasons why people face acute food insecurity is climate change. Climate variety and extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and storms can severely impact agricultural productivity. Small-scale farmers, who often lack the resources to adapt, are particularly vulnerable. For example, Zimbabwe is suffering a prolonged drought crisis which contributes to famine. Another reason is conflict. Regions affected by conflict or political instability often face challenges in food production. To be specific, wars and conflicts disrupt agricultural activities, displace populations and hinder humanitarian aid. For instance, millions of people in Gaza are on the brink of famine as they struggle to access food since the **Israel–Hamas war**.

Addressing hunger requires a comprehensive approach. Firstly, governments should promote sustainable agricultural practices that enhance resilience to climate change, conserve natural resources, and improve productivity. These measures can help ensure food security in the long term. For example, governments can introduce new laws to regulate the usage of fertilizer, which will reduce soil quality and fertility and thus impact  food productivity if used excessively. In addition, enhancing international cooperation and coordination among governments, NGOs, and international organizations is crucial for addressing food security and ensuring equitable access to food resources.

In conclusion, the reasons why many people go hungry include climate change and conflict and governments should pay more attention to sustainable development and international coordination to address food insecurity.

While some people tend to suggest it, others believe that it has more drawbacks rather than benefits. It is my belief that purchasing things from the Internet has advantages that surpass its disadvantages for the following reasons.

On the one hand, online shopping could save more time and energy rather than buying straight from the store. For example, customers need to spare their time to take a trip to the store, not to mention the money they spend on gas or public transportation tickets. Meanwhile, online shopping does not need customer presence, they only need to log into shopping platforms and  choose everything they would like to buy without having any interaction with the staff. In this case, online shopping is more convenient for busy people.

On the other hand, online shopping lacks in customers' experience to feel the materials or to at least do a trial of the stuff they want to buy. Although  reviews from former customers are provided on the platform, it does not mean  everybody will accept them since the reviews are written based on the opinion of the reviewer only. So online shopping would likely cause more disappointment after the stuff is received by the customer.

After taking everything into consideration, I would say online shopping has more benefits for the sake of time. Moreover, the occurrence of bad stuff I mentioned above could be avoided by taking more time to read the review of the products.

#priorities","In the modern era, the debate on whether government expenditure should prioritize the acceleration of public transport systems or channel funds into other significant areas remains contentious. Advocates of enhanced public transportation argue for its efficiency and environmental benefits, while opponents urge a focus on alternative priorities such as healthcare and education. This essay explores both perspectives, ultimately endorsing the balanced allocation of resources.

Proponents of investing in faster public transport systems emphasize the multifaceted advantages it brings. Primarily, it significantly reduces commute times, enabling individuals to dedicate more time to personal and professional pursuits, thereby enhancing productivity and quality of life. Moreover, rapid transit options such as high-speed trains and electric buses offer a greener alternative to private vehicles, mitigating carbon emissions and combatting urban air pollution. For instance, the introduction of the Shinkansen in Japan has not only revolutionized travel within the country but has also set a global benchmark for efficient and sustainable public transportation.

Conversely, critics argue that government funds should address more pressing societal needs. The augmentation of healthcare services, educational facilities, and affordable housing, they contend, would have a more immediate and profound impact on the populace's well-being. An investment in these sectors is seen as foundational, ensuring a healthier, more educated society capable of contributing effectively to economic growth and social stability. The case of Scandinavian countries, where extensive investment in social services has resulted in high levels of societal well-being, underscores this argument.

In summary, investing in faster public transport has clear merits, yet it's imperative to balance this with enhancements in social services. A holistic strategy that values both infrastructure and societal health is key to a progressive society. Effective resource allocation can ensure transport improvements complement, rather than overshadow, essential social needs.

For example, issues such as housing, bills, transportation, and bureaucracy have to be faced by themselves. As a consequence, the students become adults more prepared to work in the future. Additionally, living far from their parents' homes, adolescents can dedicate more time to academic subjects and they can experience life at university fully. In my personal experience, I attended college in another city far from my hometown. This situation encouraged me to manage  several problems by myself, and after graduation, I felt more confident to apply for jobs and attend interviews.

On the other hand, there are some negative aspects. One of the main cons is the cost of living higher than living at home. It is known that costs with housing and food are the major expenses. Furthermore, another disadvantage is that some people are not prepared to deal with loneliness. These people can feel homesick, or develop depression or some psychological disease.

All in all, to conclude, I think that the positive points surpass the negative aspects. The time during further education is a time for growth and personal development. So, living in another town is an excellent opportunity to increase a lot of abilities. As a result, after getting a diploma, students get more life experience and independence to address adult responsibilities.

On the one hand, the process of mechanization in the home undoubtedly saves time and human energy. Overworked and exhausted adults no longer have to worry about tedious tasks, such as doing the laundry or doing the dishes. This means they can enjoy themselves and spend quality time with loved ones.Women in particular reap the rewards as, in former times, they tended to be responsible for most of the laborious housework.They now have the opportunity either to work and become economically independent or to socialize, instead of scrubbing floors or chopping vegetables.

On the other hand, the popularity of these products has unwanted environmental consequences. Machines including vacuum cleaners and washing machines are made using nonrenewable and relatively scarce resources. When used, they are powered by large quantities of electricity, which is often obtained by burning fossil fuels. This obviously causes an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.Furthermore, as these items are deliberately designed only to last for a limited period, they soon have to be replaced and are 
thrown into landfill sites, which puts additional pressure on the ecosystem.

In conclusion, although we should not ignore the positive social and economic impact of the increasing use of modern appliances in the home, this trend is contributing to the depletion of natural resources and pollution.

#school","Technology is now becoming a daily basis necessity. There is a debatable argument between a group of people that using electronic gadgets specifically mobiles should not be allowed in learning institutions. I disagree with the idea as using mobile can be beneficial for teenagers in many ways. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss both views.

     To start with, parents provide cell phones to their children for security reasons. If a youngster is stuck in an emergency they are able to call the police or their family. For example, my cousin who is in her last year, finished her classes and was waiting for the bus at the station. However, due to weather conditions, no transport services were working. Instantly, she called her mother and she was able to reach home safely. Not only this, mobile phones provide numerous benefits in education. There are multiple educational apps which help in the betterment of studies for students. Moreover,it gives access  children to communicate with their friends for group projects remotely,

       But it should not be forgotten that every aspect has two sides, if cellphones are not prohibited on the school premises, it could affect the decorum of the institution. As learning should be pure and divine. However, keeping contact in classes enhances the risk of cheating in exams. Along with this, it may also cause distraction while professors are teaching in classrooms which leads to lower academic scores. For example, recently In the news, there was an incident where students were not paying attention  towards what they were getting taught and the whole class failed the course.

      In my perspective, using cell phones in a proper manner can bring many advantages in student's lives, if used in the right way.

On the one side,it is contended by some that it is the responsibility of individuals to prioritise their health and studying.They believe that investing in these services by  state officials can put a strain on them and can be deleterious for the welfare of  society.This is because if they allot money to these services,they can have a limited budget and they will impose high taxes to compensate for this problem.As a result,the prices of everything will increase significantly.Consequently,those who have low income cannot afford to pay for them and ultimately ,this can be detrimental to the well-being of the community.

On the other side,I would side with those who believe that education and healthcare are basic necessities and every individual should be ensured to access them by the authorities.Everyone deviates from each other according to their financial backgrounds and many of them do have not enough money to spend on these services  which can create unfairness and discrimination. It is my view that if the city administrations spend funds on them,everyone can have an opportunity to build their lives regardless of their budget limit.

Taking everything into account,the question of whether there are concerns about citizens paying for studying and health or whether these services should be provided by  state officials has valid arguments on both sides.It seems to me that residents should have a  right to build their lives and to eradicate unfairness among the society,the authorities should provide access to them.

In my opinion, a wide variety of strict rules and the limitation of income within an organization or a company discourage people from being an employee. I am also convinced that going bankrupt and paying taxes can be the drawbacks of freelancing.

It is my view that a fixed salary may cause serious problems for employees. They are restricted by a certain amount of money which is paid on a regular basis. Many employees find it difficult to make ends meet and cover their expenses. For example, in Iran, the price of housing, food and clothes are escalating alarmingly day to day. Consequently, if you are an employee who earns a fixed salary, you will be never able to manage your expenses. Furthermore, employees have to conform to special rules that are enforced by their organizations or companies. For instance, certain working hours and dress codes are of paramount importance in such offices.

I further believe that freelancing has its own difficulties. First, in some countries, economic recession may lead to the bankruptcy of businesses. They fail to make sufficient profits, and in turn, should change their work. Therefore, freelancers would face job insecurity and financial issues. Additionally, since you have your own business, you are compelled to pay taxes to the government. In some cases, self-employed people should pay around 50% of their revenue for taxes.

   

In conclusion, strict rules in workplaces and receiving a fixed salary are the reasons for choosing self-employed jobs. From my perspective, heavy taxes and going bankrupt are two downsides of freelancing.

#ones","Nowadays, governments and many people attempt to uphold historical buildings in order to increase their income. Some people believe that protecting historic buildings is more valuable than preserving the newest ones. It seems to me that rebuilding ancient relics is a worthwhile act and I will explain why in this essay.

Firstly, the renewal of old standing is a relevant solution to restore the chronicles and identity of the nations. It means that people could comprehend their ancestor achievements in this way and pride their identity extremely. For example, Persepolis located in Shiraz displays the power and glory of the Achaemenid empire capital, and Kurosh the first king of the Achaemenid dynasty established to rule is a well-known place in the world that Iranian people are proud of. A second factor is that historical structure could be a symbol of civilization and culture of the society that it can attach ancient generations to new ones. Therefore, memorable edifices could show life conditions in the past. For instance, the air pocket of structures in Yazd shows that people used to cool the air inside the houses by this method they adapt themselves to hot and dry weather. This leads us to the final and perhaps most significant element that protecting old buildings can have an intensive impact on countries' income by attracting tourists This means that if tourists visit these places, an economic boom will happen. For instance, Egypt can earn lots of money from its pyramids. 

Indeed, some claim that renovating historical constructions costs a lot and is not affordable. Despite this, it seems that the preservation of aged buildings is a valuable investment for the countries.

  In conclusion, it seems maintaining ancient structures can help economic growth, by recognizing chronicles, and cultural symbols. Although protest pretense restoration has a sheer cost correct management of reconstruction costs will be lower.

#assistance
#food","It is argued that countries with high incomes have to allow a larger number of refugees to cross their borders. I completely agree with this statement because it is morally correct and beneficial for their economies in the long term.

It is not adequate just to watch other nations suffering from being deprived of food and safety. Wealthy states are capable of helping those who require this help. War, hunger, and other negative circumstances happen all the time around the world. Rich states have well-developed agricultural and construction sectors, so it should not be challenging to provide a ""safety net"" to displaced people. For example, many European regions were involved in the biggest migration crisis in the past decade, and provided shelter to millions of foreigners, showing a good example of humanity.

Besides being cheerful, a positive effect of  migration can be achieved. Some of those, who had to leave their homeland, will start settling down, opening businesses, and becoming a labour force in the end. In addition to that, it will be  quite beneficial for economies over a long distance, because a lot of new jobs will appear leading to an increase in incomes for local areas, and it can boost economic growth overall. One of the prominent examples is the migration policy of the USA; people from abroad were accepted, sheltered, and allowed to open businesses thereby increasing the country's GDP.

In conclusion, from an ethical point of view nations have to support each other and provide all the necessary stuff like food or accommodations for refugees. Moreover, this movement can be paid back in advance by those who were adopted, resulting in an upward trend in the labour market.

Some believe that stopping their smoking habit will lead to unbearable withdrawal of nicotine. Furthermore, even if the said population knows about the impact it has on the body, the withdrawal caused by  nicotine addiction leads to important mood swings and terrible pain, which no one wants to deal with. For instance, a study led by Harvard University in 2021 in China, the country with the largest population of smokers, showed that 60% of the surveyed Chinese are well aware of the consequences on their bodies, yet they express the need to satisfy their nicotine cravings. 

An effective solution to this problem would revolve around the creation of a campaign. Moreover, creating publicities is a good way to have an impact on individuals since marketing strategies use sociological approaches in order to influence any opinion. This solution could help in having an influence on those who have a smoking addiction. For example, in 2017, the French government launched a campaign called “Look at the Kid”. The purpose was to impact couples that smoked and target the potential desire to have a child. The publicity series was successful, leading to a decrease in the quantity of French smokers by 5% in 8 months. 

To conclude, this problem is caused by the addictive aspect of smoking but can be resolved thanks to the use of publicity strategies.

To begin with, the elderly have trouble catching up with new developments in technology because computers and the internet are fundamentally novel. Furthermore, laptops require a skill set that is completely foreign to humans who did not grow up in the last 30 years. To utilize these kinds of gadgets, one must be able to type, set up online accounts, recall passwords, troubleshoot IT problems and navigate both the internet and a wide range of internet-based apps. For those born into the internet era, this is all second nature, but for others, the learning curve is often too steep. The simple process of turning on these sorts of appliances and locating programs exploiting an unfamiliar interface can be overwhelming and serves as the principal, initial barrier.

On the other hand, the best solutions for this relate to education. Firstly, older people who are still working require special training programs and patience from their employers and themselves. Competence is likely given detailed instructions and enough time to practice. Secondly, a great deal of retired citizens want to spend more time with their kids, grandchildren and old friends, but it can be difficult to travel, particularly if they live far apart. Old-timers would be enormously motivated to make video calls and keep in touch with familiar ones with applications like Skype, Facetime and so on. Through simple instructions from family members, it is possible that video-conferencing could become a routine task.

In a nutshell, elders today often can not understand the machinery because it is a seismic shift in perspective and the solutions involve patient training at work and home. In this way, the benefits of technology can be extended to a generation that missed out on them in their youth.

Some societies have a notion that it can result in increased quality of life and people live longer compared to the past. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will delve into the salient impacts that modern science has on individuals and societies as a whole.

First and foremost, it is evident that we live in a digital and modernized world. Thus, all the things that surround us develop constantly and these improvements have wide-ranging effects on healthcare, like in all fields. Initially, robots can participate in delicate surgeries, reducing the risk of human error and increasing patient outcomes. Furthermore, today, more and more laboratories have a plethora of experiments to generate and improve the quality of medicines. 

There is no doubt that the consequences of modern medical science are manifold and invaluable. Hence, the enhancements in healthcare can directly affect people, providing them with fast and painless services. Perhaps an eminent example of this would be the surgeries when the doctors use lasers and they make operations less painful, diminishing the time required to heal. Additionally, the potential positive results from the medicine trials may pave the way for accelerating the healing process. 

In conclusion, after having meticulously discussed this phenomenon, it is important to emphasize that the good repercussions of modern science on medical care are far-reaching and cannot be ignored. Scientists should continue their practices on medicines and technology to stave off diseases, mitigating the dire ramifications of traditional medicine while protecting the posterity from possible threats.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","#people
#age","The last 50 years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of marriages in lower ages even from 8 or 9. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether it is better to settle down at an earlier age or leave it  after 21. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay, I would contend that working on goals and postponing marriage even after 25 would lead to more successful and happier consequences.

First of all, it is an indisputable fact that rather than concentrating on getting married at a younger age, determining goals and working hard to achieve them should be a priority in humans’ lives. In order to have a more successful marriage, gaining skills or academic education related to the dream job, which enables individuals to have a higher salary and a wealthy life is more advisable. Otherwise, it would lead to economic dependency on parents, which, contributes to unappealing feelings and loss of confidence.

Secondly and even more importantly, though, is the fact that due to the lack of knowledge and experience, starting a family from less than 21 years old would result in disadvantageous ramifications. According to the statistics, the number of divorces among couples less than 25 was 10 times higher than those higher than 25 in 2021 in Iran country. So, before getting married, gaining a job and engaging in social life would lead to the expansion of the horizon of thinking and opting more logically in the process of marriage.

By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although settling down from under 21 would be accompanied by some benefits, the irreparable drawbacks seen in most cases are incomparable with those benefits. Thus, regulating a legal age for marriage would contribute to the advancement of societies.

First of all, it is an indisputable fact that providing the opportunity to utilize these generations’ experiences in various aspects of managing a country could be accounted as an invaluable asset. According to the statistics, a salient example of this could be Japan country, which, rehires retired individuals in more prominent management positions in order to gain the most efficient benefits. So rather than viewing them as  outdated people, providing the opportunity to implement their worthwhile ideas would contribute to benefit the whole country.

Yet perhaps the strongest argument in favour of this opinion is the fact that despite the expenses spent for their treatment or their insurance, they could play a supportive role for their children and grandchildren. As the expenditure of life has soared in recent years and both parents have to work in order to afford the costs of life, grandparents could take the responsibility of caring for their children. So, implementing more effectively at work is more likely as worries related to the care of children are alleviated by the support of elders.

By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that the ageing population is accounted as the grace of god. Thus, rather than neglecting them as hassles to governments, they have significant potential for the advancement of societies.

#uniform","In this day and age, it is considered by a plethora of individuals that, a good deal of schools have made uniforms obligatory. However, there are plenty of schools where students are allowed to dress what they want. In this following essay, I shall express the merits and demerits of wearing a uniform.

To begin with, there are several examples of this statement. The prime advantages are the elimination of social and economic differences and instilling discipline. First and foremost, when all the students wear the same clothes, they look alike and a sense of equality is created among them. For instance, with the same dress code, it becomes sophisticated for others to know the social and economic status of kids. This saves poor juniors from bullying or partiality. Secondly, it helps to instil discipline in children because the dress costume obliges them to comply with the rules and regulations of an academy. As an example, if a student is found smoking or wearing a school uniform, then they can be punished as per the academy's regulations as this implies that the act was committed even after being aware of the regulations.

On the other hand, there are a great deal of ideas for this viewpoint. The foremost disadvantage is that it suppresses the kid's creativity and individuality. It is widely accepted that creativity is needed in every sphere of life to be successful. A youngster needs to create a bridge between  creativity and knowledge to discover something new. For example, kids will not be able to highlight themselves and experiment and they will lose out on thinking out of the box. Multiple studies prove that the mandatory status of uniforms may turn children into passive youth who cannot express themselves via their dressing style. Therefore, it is significant to enhance  creativity and individuality while their personalities are still developing.

In a nutshell, putting on a school uniform can be beneficial as it allows to diminish the social and economic divides. In addition, it should not be forgotten that it limits the creativity of a young mind.

#food
#people
#diets
#governments","Some individuals have improper diets due to easy reach to fast food meals. This leads to some difficulties and this essay will discuss its reasons and solutions.

On the one hand, it is generally acknowledged that widespread colourful advertisements of fast food absorb citizens' attention , especially the younger generation. They tend to use whatever they find trend by seeing its adverts. Additionally, a lack of information about the negative points of fast food can be another cause of people's unhealthy choices. As a matter of fact, fast food manufacturers do not attempt to inform their customers about the inadequate quality of their products. For instance, the high amount of fat in fast food which will bring obesity is not mentioned anywhere in users' information.

On the other hand, it is self-evident that governments must prepare some TV programs and environmental adverts to reintroduce traditional food to the younger generation and encourage them to choose healthier alternatives. If high-quality food had as much advertisement as fast food, it would definitely attract customers' attention. Moreover, writing about the harmful factors of each kind of fast food on the pack  in order to inform people about the long-term effects on their health will let them choose their diet wisely. A point in view is the sentence on the pack of cigarettes which is written: ""This product has different materials that are harmful to your health, try not to use it"".

Consequently, dwellers' preference to eat fast food rather than traditional and healthy food has some reasons why authorities must take necessary actions to persuade people to choose the best alternative. This essay checked some causes and introduced proper solutions which can be done to increase society's health standards.

This surge in curiosity can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the desire to connect with the past and understand the lineage of one's dwelling plays a pivotal role in driving this inclination. By delving into the history of their homes, people seek to establish a sense of belonging and identity rooted in the narratives of previous occupants and the surrounding community. Moreover, the resurgence of architectural appreciation has fueled this trend. With an increased appreciation for craftsmanship and design, individuals are motivated to explore the origins of their residences, thereby gaining insight into the architectural evolution of their locality. Furthermore, the advent of technology has facilitated easy access to historical records and archives, enabling people to embark on comprehensive research journeys from the comfort of their homes. Online databases, digitized records, and virtual tours offer invaluable resources for individuals eager to unravel the past of their dwellings. To delve deeper into the history of their houses or buildings, people can employ various research methodologies. This may involve consulting local archives, historical societies, or municipal records to unearth documents such as property deeds, census data, or architectural plans. Additionally, engaging with local historians, conducting interviews with previous occupants, or utilizing genealogical resources can provide valuable insights into the lineage and anecdotes associated with the residence. In conclusion, the burgeoning interest in investigating the history of residences stems from a desire for connection, architectural appreciation, and technological advancements. Through meticulous research efforts, individuals can unravel the rich tapestry of narratives embedded within the walls of their homes, fostering a deeper appreciation for their heritage and sense of place.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","#internet
#newspapers","In our fast-paced and digital world, the future of newspapers has long been a subject of controversial debate. Some people have a notion that the burgeoning popularity of the internet can lead to the loss of interest in newspapers. In the forthcoming paragraphs, this essay will elucidate the reasons why I partially agree with this opinion and provide a reasonable conclusion from my standpoint.

First and foremost, it is undeniable that the internet has became
 an undisputable part of our daily lives. People of all ages utilize social media platforms to make connections with each other, share cherished moments and keep up with the events which occur all around the world. Perhaps the eminent examples of this would be the online formats of magazines such as The Forbes and The Times. While the readers have a chance to reach them online, they may find it preferable.

Turning to the other side of the paradigm, the older generation's priorities and preferences can can be various, in terms of using mediums. They do not only read magazines and newspapers to be aware of the daily news but also use it as a way to unwind their mind during the reading process. Furthermore, some people of old age do not know how they can appropriately use the websites, or even do not have any electronic devices to access the internet.

In conclusion, after having meticulously discussed all the aspects of this phenomenon, I cannot concur with this idea wholeheartedly in the wake of the above-mentioned reasons. It is evident that  various social media can be used as  alternatives to paper-based resources, whereas  newspapers and magazines cannot be completely replaced with  online sources due to the old demand.

#females
#males","In this day and age, more companies are making attempts to recruit and retain the differences between the total of female and male employees to the least. However, in my opinion, it can be possible in some specific fields, and the overwhelming sum of males is inevitable in physical jobs.

On the one hand, I accept that modern workplaces in some domains such as the service industry and paperwork are likely to have  equal statistics of male and female workers. In fact, in many organizations these days, more job vacancies are available for girls than in the past, meaning that women nowadays can have the same opportunities as boys to be employed in some positions, even taking  leadership. Besides, with outstanding and special human instincts, aesthetic abilities or detail-oriented personalities, for example,  girls can even do better than boys in some specific careers, contributing to an increase in the number of ladies in modern workplaces.

On the other hand, I argue that it seems to be challenging and impossible to maintain the equivalent numbers of male and female employees in jobs requiring physical health. As a matter of fact, careers such as astronauts  have very high requirements for physical health in order to deal with intensive training and tough conditions without gravity when taking a mission to explore a new planet, so it is likely to be more suitable for guys than females. In addition, regarding some manual work in society such as builders and porters, although a few women can be recruited for these vacancies, the sum of men by far outweighs that of ladies since males seem to be stronger and healthier to do the jobs more efficiently. 

In conclusion, maintaining an equal figure of fathers and females in workplaces should be highly recommended, further, I am still more convinced that it can just be feasible in some industries, and with careers whose prerequisite requirement is good health and fitness, it is unavoidable to witness a surpassing figure of persons compared with mothers.

#development","A lot of people nowadays are drawn to buying branded things such as vehicles, clothes and bags. Some of the reasons behind this fad is because of the quality of luxury goods and the influence of famous artists and I think that this is a negative development because this can lead to debts. 

One of the reasons why many prefer to buy branded material is because of their quality. Despite its expensive price, it can be used for a long time, thus, the consumers get value for their money. In addition to that, artists can influence the choices of the community. Many celebrities are posting their lavish lifestyle on social media and they get many likes from all over the world. That is why their followers tend to follow them because many of them think that it can make them famous as well. For instance, Kylie Jenner is one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram and her followers buy all the expensive brands she posts in the hopes that they get many likes as well.

However, I think that this is a negative development because this may lead to the accumulation of debts. Many populations may feel unsatisfied about their life and they might feel that the only way to be happy is by having luxury finished goods. As a result, they can end up in debt in order to achieve these things. For example, most crowds nowadays are in excessive debt because of buying luxury brands so that other folks think that they are classy. Hence, buying expensive products more than one's financial capacity is not a good thing.

In conclusion, many populations are buying expensive brands for many reasons and some of them are because of the quality and the influence of celebrities. However, I believe that this is a negative development because this can lead to debts.

Although there may be valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay, I would contend that the drawbacks associated with this trend are incomparable with the benefits. Two primary reasons for this are as follows.

First of all, it is an indisputable fact that the relocation of the rural population to urban areas for the sake of better life facilities would lead to a recession in the agriculture industry. A salient example of this is Tehran the capital of Iran where according to the statistics more than half of the villages remained isolated in 2017 and the production of agricultural products declined by 20 percent. Furthermore, it is obvious that continuing this phenomenon would result in the integration of new movers into modern urban culture and forgetting the national cultural heritage. 

Secondly and even more importantly though, is the fact that the climb in the number of the urban population would disrupt the balance between the supply and demand, in destination cities. People will compete for staples like employment or owning a home. so, predictable would be inflation as well as unemployment and criminal behaviours in urban regions. Admittedly growth in traffic congestion, air pollution and water pollution is more likely to appear following this trend.

By the way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although a wide range of facilities are concentrated in urban areas, which, attract many people to those places, the mentioned drawbacks would be insurmountable in the foreseeable future. So, taking policies to reverse this trend is likely to be more constructive.

#phones
#tablets
#cinema","Some argue that portable devices have made theatres redundant, while others claim that films need to be seen in a cinema in order to be fully appreciated. Both sides of the argument will first be elaborated on before explaining why, ultimately, I side with the latter.

One view is that films can be fully enjoyed on small screens, such as phones or tablets. The main reason for this is the convenience. With the proliferation of streaming services, it is easier than ever to access films on small screens, and individuals can watch them wherever and whenever they like. For example, someone could log into Netflix on their phone and watch the latest release during their daily commute by train. Additionally, small screens may provide a more intimate viewing experience, as individuals can watch films in their own space and at their own pace.

However, there are also several reasons why opponents believe films may need to be seen in a cinema in order to be fully enjoyed. One is the enhanced visual and audio experience that a theatre can provide. With larger screens and better sound systems, motion pictures can be more immersive and impactful in a cinema setting. Many cinema complexes now offer even 4D options that have moving seats to make the viewer feel like they are part of the action.  Furthermore, the social aspect of watching films in a cinema can be a key part of the enjoyment, as individuals can share the experience with others and engage in discussions about the film afterwards.

In conclusion, although both arguments are logical, in my view, the enhanced visual and audio experience, as well as the social aspect, can be key to fully appreciating a film. I believe that with excessive media options available on mobile devices, recapturing the romance of a trip to the theatre with loved ones should be cherished.

#effects
#epidemic","Over the past decades, the number of overweight people has increased, and this trend is being observed nowadays. This essay will discuss the main reasons for this epidemic and then describe the possible effects of the problem.

To begin with, the foremost causes of obesity are an inactive lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits. Today, more and more people rely on cars instead of walking, have fewer physical demands at work, and prefer inactive leisure activities. This results in burning fewer calories and gaining weight. Moreover, the problem is accentuated by the growing number of people who eat irregularly and consume large portions of high-calorie food. For example, about 50% of the adult population in Europe suffers from being overweight due to disordered eating habits.

The possible effects of this problem include physical health problems and loss of productivity. Firstly, obesity results in the incorrect functioning of the human body and contributes to the risk of developing some chronic illnesses. For example, as body fat percentage increases, the person's metabolism worsens, which in turn may result in diabetes or heart disease. Furthermore, overweight people are very unhealthy and often suffer from stress and tiredness. This lessens their work capacity and leads to lower productivity. For instance, it has been proven that an obese person needs to put more effort into completing some tasks than a person with normal weight.

To sum up, obesity is a big issue that affects a lot of people nowadays. It is mainly caused by inactive lifestyles and eating disorders and has a detrimental impact on severe health problems and loss of productivity.

#development","It is evident that nowadays many children spend a lot of time using their smartphones. The variety of smartphones’ uses may contribute to this case and I feel that this is harmful to children’s health.

I think this situation may be caused by the development of smartphones and it is also partly because children can not limit themselves. Children can not restrict themselves well so they are likely to be fascinated by interesting things. With the evolution of smartphones, today children can get a good kick out of them , they can play games, find interesting things, watch films and TV series as well as read stories on mobile phones. As a result, children, the people who are not able to control themselves well, will be fully attracted to smartphones. For instance, if they do each thing for an hour per day, then the total time will become at least four hours--it is long enough for children. 

This case is projected to pose a threat to children’s health. Everyone has only 24 hours per day, so if children pay closer attention to playing on mobile , they will have fewer hours to exercise . Then this will lead to a weak body and it will be easy for them to catch an illness. And it is believed that using smartphones too often is responsible for bad eyesight. If we allow kids to spend too much time utilising phones, they will have to wear a pair of glasses at an early age.

To sum up, the reason why children spend a long time on smartphones is the many uses of smartphones and their lack of self-control and this will present a challenge to their health.

If you look at most of the well-paid job advertisements in various applications or websites, the minimum requirement for applying for these positions is having relevant university-certified qualifications. For example, to become a successful lawyer or doctor, one should study at a prestigious university and obtain the necessary certification. Moreover, many educational institutions provide their students with appropriate apprenticeships after graduation,offering valuable insights into career prospects and the work environment.

On the other hand, having relevant experience in a real-world environment can help candidates develop essential personality traits such as strong interpersonal skills, leadership skills and the ability to work efficiently in a team. For instance, when applying for a place in sales, marketing or customer service departments in a business company, the human resource manager typically looks for a resume with related experiences rather than just higher education certifications.

In conclusion, the controversial debate about the crucial factor in securing the best job opportunity continues. In my perspective, the value of an educational degree versus soft skills largely depends on the type of a 
profession and the employer’s circumstances at the time of applying for employment opportunities.

#health","Some workers are not exercising enough during their daily routine and some of them are developing health issues as a consequence. This essay discusses the reasons behind this phenomenon and the solutions to the matter.

There are two main reasons why employees do not do physical activities regularly. The first of these is due to poor time management. This is because workers often schedule too many daily activities and end up not accomplishing some personal ones. For instance, home-based job workers often have trouble finishing tasks earlier to do their daily workouts. Moreover, tiredness is another common reason why people skip exercising. The reason for this is that workers usually finish their professional duties at night when they are too exhausted to go to the gym and, therefore, they might choose to spend the rest of the day resting.

However, some strategies might help mitigate these difficulties. Firstly, one should try exercising before engaging in their job. This is due to recent studies that have shown that working out in the morning brings more consistency to people's health routine since they usually feel more energetic at this time of the day. For example, the elderly tend to do physical activities in the morning because it is when their bodies are fully rested. Furthermore, having a gym partner helps the individual commit to their workout schedule. This is because doing sports can be more fun with a friend. In particular, workout partners can serve as mental support when one's lacking motivation.

In conclusion, the reasons why workers are skipping their exercise are related to poor time management and exhaustion after working all day. The possible solutions to this matter are going to the gym before work commitments and gathering workout partners.

Besides that, when a famous and huge undertaking happens, it contributes to the hosting countries not only gaining massive positive aspects but also disadvantages mentioned in this essay.

On the one hand, a country can own the polity to organize a global game that helps their nation achieve many advantages through this event. On top of that, the sporting games bring a significant economic promotion to the host. People invest a massive part of the government budget to erect infrastructure, facilities, and accommodations for competitors and visitors. In addition, hosting residents can have a wonderful chance to sell local products and advertise their speciality to tourists and viewers. Furthermore, inhabitants can have more opportunities to exchange their culture and traditions with others in the world. 

On the other hand, it is undoubted that the hosting nation also suffers some disadvantages from organizing a huge sporting event. Firstly, they spend much more of their money on the sporting sector resulting in a lack of financial resources for others. Secondly, the routine residents’ lives may be distracted by massive domestic and international viewers, especially elders. Besides that, to ensure the security of competitors and participants, especially politicians or governmental people, organizers utilize a massive security operation.

In conclusion, many countries hope to set up an international sporting event such as the World Cup to achieve surplus advantages outweighing to disadvantages for the locals.

#celebrities","There has been much debate regarding the role of famous people in raising public awareness of the major problems. While some contend that celebrities can attract people’s attention to  problems, others believe that they can make them less critical. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.

On the one hand, supporters argue that endorsements of international aid organizations by figures draw attention to pressing global issues. Celebrities often have large platforms and widespread influence which they can leverage to raise public awareness and mobilize resources for humanitarian causes. To illustrate, a well-known Vietnamese singer named Thuy Tien used her fame to raise a fund of two million dollars to assist citizens who suffered heavily from natural disasters. Additionally, the superstar can use their status to advocate for policy changes and drive fundraising efforts, resulting in tangible support for affected communities.

Conversely, critics comment that celebrity involvement in international assistance can sometimes overshadow the subjects themselves and detract from more substantial solutions. There is concern that focusing on celebrity endorsement may create a superficial understanding of  complex matters, leading to tokenistic gestures and short-term solutions rather than addressing the root causes. Moreover, although initial attention to a cause can spike due to celebrity endorsement, there is the risk that this consideration may not be sustained over time. Once the star moves on to another cause or project, the public’s interest may wane, leaving organizations without the needed long-term support.

In conclusion, the impact of celebrity involvement in international aid organizations is nuanced and context-dependent. Whilst celebrities can undoubtedly bring attention to important issues and mobilize resources, their engagement should be approached with caution and critical scrutiny. It is essential to ensure that their involvement is genuine, informed, and respectful of the communities they seek to support. In addition, efforts should be made to amplify the voices of local activists and institutions working on the ground, as they often possess invaluable insights and solutions tailored to their specific contexts. Ultimately, effective advocacy and support for international aid require a collaborative and inclusive approach that prioritizes the dignity, agency, and empowerment of affected communities.

My commitment to maintaining optimal health is evident through my active participation in sports, particularly basketball, from elementary school to high school. Throughout the pandemic and continuing until now, I have made a deliberate effort to prioritize physical activity by ensuring I walked over 10,000 steps on weekend mornings. 

However, I occasionally experience indigestion due to irregular meal times. Hence, since living alone, I have adopted a more consistent eating schedule, complemented by always keeping medications on hand every time I go out. Also, I always try to be mindful of my plate, sorting out  nutritious and balanced meals while reducing sugar intake to maintain a healthy diet in the host country.

Being wary of lifestyle differences, especially in the UK or Singapore, where walking is more prevalent, I have adapted walking to the campus in Depok to minimize transportation costs. This not only contributes to my physical activity but also is more cost-efficient. Additionally, I engage in weekly badminton sessions with friends as a lighter form of exercise. Looking ahead, I plan to continue doing sports in the host country, utilizing the sports facilities and park.

For mental health, I am well aware of its significance, since I faced some challenges during my first year of living alone. I had to accept being surrounded only by myself most of the time, but it was not that severe to do extensive counselling. I learned how to cope by watching my favourite YouTube channel, ""Satu Persen"". To focus on self-improvement, I dedicated more time to self-reflection and cultivating new habits. 

Interestingly, I have developed a newfound interest in reading, using books to fill the void. Also, incorporating self-journaling, I often express my days through video storytelling in English. Notably, my English language skills have improved significantly, from a previous score of 5.5 last year in a mock test to a more fluent level. This practice not only improved my language skills but also served as a stress release.

#city","Overpopulated countries experience severe pressure on local transportation systems these days. One path to resolve the issue is to develop public transport networks like a subway. It is agreed that the metro is the best way to get around big cities. This essay will highlight some advantages of underground trains and provide several examples to support the points.

To begin with, a well-designed underground train network can drastically reduce pressure on an overwhelmed road system. For instance, over the last several decades, Singapore has diminished the total traffic level by fifty-two per cent by launching new underground transportation lines. Before these changes, the city experienced severe jams even at night, and such change was warmly embraced by society. Thus, Singapore's experience can be a good example for mayors of all cities in the world.

In addition, the majority of subway systems worldwide are electric-based facilities which do not exert additional pressure on the Earth's finite, depleting resources. For example, according to a study conducted at the University of North Carolina, the average citizen who prefers public electrical transport like a metro produces seventy per cent less carbon dioxide compared to his vehicle-driving neighbour. As a result, underground movements are not only the fastest manner to reach the destination point but also a convenient way to save the planet.

To sum up, the underground is a great example of a modern and effective means of transportation which solves not only traffic problems in metropolises but preserves our planet too. All together, the aforementioned benefits make the subway the best alternative to move across cities now and in the future. It is predicted that electric underground train networks will steadily supersed personal vehicles in the foreseeable future.

I generally disagree with this, for they offer a unique experience that is not provided by the digital device despite its growing popularity.

On the one hand, museums and art galleries are essential since they provide a special moment for inspiration. In other words, a number of collections of historical paintings and sculptures are exhibited to surprise the viewers with the sophisticated skills of each artist to produce such precise images. Furthermore, the strong touches of the brush, which are hardly recognized on the computer screen, make them look more animated to the visitors, who feel like they are actually in the scene. For instance, they are able to experience the feeling of exhaustion of the workers, smell glasses and hear the voices of others as well as understand the severe poverty and the harsh physical workload, when observing the painting called ""Gleaning"" carefully. Therefore, museums and art galleries can offer stimulating experiences that are not attained on the digital screen. 

 On the other hand, there is a declining need for art facilities due to the prevalent uses of computers today. Indeed, they have made it more convenient for everyone to access a wide range of information, which is often sorted by category, chronological order and artists. Moreover, they include insightful explanations for each artwork from specialists, leading to the accumulation of knowledge about their beliefs and facts in history. Consequently, interest in art increases even among those who have never been to museums thanks to the abundant materials of  art online. 

In conclusion, I have a partial disagreement about the reduced need for museums and art galleries for the incredible impression people can gain. However, the growing spread of technological devices which allow them to obtain  various information about art is likely to affect their importance.

#point","Climate change is one of the largest challenges that people face in this century. However, this is a controversial topic due to the varying opinions of differing groups. One mode of thought, which prevails in the popular mood, is for the onset of renewables on an industrial scale. Contrastingly, others believe fossil fuels are necessary to maintain the current economic system. In my opinion, the use of sustainable sources should be given priority. 

Firstly, the abusive nature of oil and gas leads to a deterioration of the environment, which has been  evidenced in recent times. For example, the rising global temperatures are causing the ice caps to melt which are impacting the level of the oceans, which in turn, are precipitating adverse weather conditions in many parts of the world. Under these circumstances, using clean energy is a necessity, rather than a choice. Moreover, climate change is here in the present and not in a distant future. The effects of this phenomenon are now visible. As an example, studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between unusual weather conditions and increased heat. 

Secondly, alternative sources of energy can be made economically viable in the long run. To begin with, the exploitation of such energies will give rise to new industries. This, in turn, will result in more employment opportunities. Furthermore, new research can help in making these energies more efficient so that they can be used in traditional industries. For instance, in countries like Germany and the Netherlands, wind power is extensively used by households and the manufacturing industry. Thus, with time, renewable fuels can contribute to the development of the economy.

In conclusion, I think alternative modes of power should be reinforced in the forthcoming decades, due to all the advantages they will create.

#activities","In life education and sports play an important role. However, some parents argue that parents should urge their children to engage in more physical activity rather than studying academic subjects. I completely agree with this notion and the reasons for my opinion will be illustrated in the forthcoming paragraph with relevant illustrations.

To begin with, to achieve anything you must remain healthy. To emphasize, physical activity provides more opportunities for individuals to become strong. As a result, it allows students to study more and enhances children's health. Even if a student has an excellent academic performance in daily life, his grade will be affected if he suffers from several health conditions. Therefore, it is essential to maintain physical fitness to perform better in all situations.

In addition, playing more games may inspire an interest in their communication skills and improve their social circle, as the majority of games include teamwork. To explain, when youths have the chance to play with other team members, they have a greater chance to interact with a different personality.  For instance, a game of hockey requires six players. Teammates must develop positive relationships with one another, which leads to a greater understanding of each individual's activities and interests. Therefore, it is essential to devote more time to physical activities to become involved in the world.

In conclusion, I believe that parents should encourage their children to devote more time to outdoor activities than to academics, as the fact that physical activity keeps the human body fit and provides opportunities to interact with others.

#time
#activities","It is sometimes argued that parents should convince their kids to take the time to do physical activities rather than study. Personally, I completely agree with the statement for several reasons which will be given out in this essay. 

First and foremost, it can be said with certainty that regular physical exercises are essential for maintaining both mental and physical condition. By this, I mean that doing these could lead to better sleep patterns, promoting deeper and restful sleep, and positively impacting mental strength. Furthermore, engaging in physical activities promotes overall physical well-being, as offspring participate in sports and exercises, thereby reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues. For instance, in Asia, where kids spend most of their time studying, developing the risk of health problems, often resulting in sleep deprivation and stress. Therefore, it is essential for parents to support their children in balancing between studying and staying healthy. 

Secondly, a special consideration is that joining a team sport would allow kids to develop important social skills. The main basis is probably because a team sport would offer increased opportunities to meet new people, creating environments for children to communicate, cooperate and engage in teamwork. To illustrate this, consider the case of badminton, there are two individuals in one team, highlighting the significance of cooperation and teamwork in securing the top prize. Therefore, the advantages of doing physical activities far outweigh those of studying. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe parents should encourage children to be aware of spending more time exercising due to the benefits of fitness and social skills.

However, they do not have the same idea about what a perfect civilization would look like. I personally think that there are two indicators that can measure the perfection of a society in the modern world: proper infrastructure and employment opportunity. This essay discusses these factors and the ways to achieve that ideal association followed by examples.

Firstly, a perfect community must possess robust infrastructure and efficient services to meet the fundamental needs of its inhabitants. Take folks living in Melbourne as an example, Melbourne is claimed as the most livable city in the world and the citizens can be classified as living an ideal way of life. This city boasts a multitude of modern foundation elements, including state-of-the-art public health centres, schools, bus stops, and various other essential facilities. Additionally, the city offers excellent services at the airport and local government offices. These optimal conditions are made possible when citizens consistently pay their taxes and adhere to the established regulations. Tax revenue serves as a valuable resource for developing sophisticated public facilities. When the community follows these regulations, they can expect high-quality sustenance for its residents.

Secondly, An ideal community requires an ample number of job opportunities to cater for the demands of its people. Adequate job prospects provide individuals with a satisfactory income and the promise of a promising career. Take Los Angeles, for instance, where the majority of the population dedicates a significant portion of their time to work and enjoys favourable financial conditions. Such a scenario can be established within a society if its citizens are encouraged to become entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship opens up new employment avenues, ultimately reducing unemployment rates and fostering economic growth.

In conclusion, a perfect civilization must possess comprehensive infrastructure, essential servings, and ample employment opportunities. This condition can be cultivated through tax contributions, policy compliance, and the creation of job opportunities by entrepreneurs.

In my opinion, while some personal characteristics can cause people to commit a crime, education and parental upbringing play a role in preventing children from criminal activities.

 

Engaging in criminal activities can result from some personal traits. Initially, when acting as selfish and arrogant people, individuals may consider a right for themselves to carry out any activity without considering regulations or even others' advice. For example, in Vietnam, studies indicated that criminals who were arrested presented rarely  disciplined behaviour during their childhood due to the schools' records. Moreover, as people may be irresponsible in both their social and personal lives, they are less likely to think about their social status, thus not respecting laws or others' rights. Ultimately, because people may be brought up with the features of impatience and intolerance, they may be unable to handle hard situations, especially  economic issues, leading to a temptation to satisfy their needs illegally.

 

Notwithstanding, teachers and parents should take the responsibility to teach children to abide laws. In the first place, as a school is like a minor society to live life, teachers should set the rules for the classes, which if children do not follow, they will be confronted with a mild punishment. Students, therefore, will practise to respect laws to avoid negative consequences. Furthermore, were children not to come from a family where the parents themselves broke laws, they would not be potentially prepared to ignore regulations in society. This is because there is a  close between parental upbringing and children's personality. For instance, in accordance with a study in Japan, a large proportion of criminals belonged to unstable families which had experienced crimes to accommodate their needs. Consequently, parents should be extremely concerned about the environment, in which children are brought up. 

 

In conclusion, although it may be acceptable  that people with a few characteristics have more potential for offensive behaviour, it is hard to deny the roles of families and schools to learn how to respect laws as well as citizens' rights.

#case","In recent times, the number of people who tend to run their own businesses has increased significantly. This is owing to the fact that  job independence brings great  benefits to the owner in terms of economic aspects and having a flexible timetable. I would argue that this trend has its own disadvantages which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. 

One of the primary rationales behind the increasing preference for self-employment is the strong desire for independence and control over your time. To elaborate on my point, if you work on your own, you might have the capability to manage your schedules geared to your lifestyle. What it means is that  there is no obligation to be in your workplace at a certain time. For instance, being freelance can pave the way for earning more money since the profits are not shared with an employer. 

On the other hand, embarking on a self-employment journey also entails a set of distinct drawbacks. To present a better explanation, one of the primary problems is the absence of job security and benefits typically provided by traditional employment including health insurance and paid leave. Furthermore, statistics show that  business owners might have to deal with more stress as it is challenging to maintain a work-life balance. To cite an example, one of my friends started up  her online shop. After a while, she had a panic attack as she was so  agitated about paying  her debts and she was fully responsible for all the work ranging from financial management and customer service.

To sum up, having an independent occupation can be rewarding regarding financial issues and flexibility. As far as I am concerned, it has some merits but the disadvantages outweigh the positive parts.

#life","It is true that some traditional beliefs upheld by older generations are no longer pertinent for the younger generation's preparation for contemporary life. While I agree that certain conventional ideas have become obsolete, I believe that many traditional values continue to hold significance and should be respected in the present day.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that some traditional norms have lost their relevance. For example, the advice often given to graduates, suggesting they pursue secure and conventional careers like administration or teaching, is increasingly irrelevant. The advent of the Internet and other technological advancements have expanded the array of career opportunities. Moreover, forcing young women to marry partners they have no emotional connection with is considered conservative, as they now possess the right to choose their life partners.

On the other hand, numerous traditional ideas retain their relevance and should be revered. For instance, the timeless wisdom that success is achieved through self-learning and hard work remains indispensable for the youth, given the ever-competitive job market. In addition, traditional values of politeness and good manners are invaluable in the contemporary world, where individuals from diverse backgrounds often collaborate and interact. These qualities foster harmonious relationships and effective communication in an increasingly globalized society. 

In conclusion, although certain traditional beliefs have become outdated and no longer serve the younger generation, many of these values continue to be relevant and should be preserved. The challenge is to strike a balance between embracing contemporary progress and upholding enduring traditional principles to equip the younger generation with a holistic and adaptive approach to modern life.

#people
#development","In recent times, we can find that many global firms are growing more rapidly than before. Some people suggest that this phenomenon is bad progress while I personally believe that the progress of international corporations should not be deemed as a negative fact.  

On the one hand, there are two main reasons why people think that the growth of international companies is a negative trend. Firstly, the development of local businesses will be negatively affected because global companies give a competitive price to customers. In general, transnational corporations have an advanced position to negotiate the price of raw materials due to the vast demand, therefore, the cost of production is much lower than small local firms, and thus the selling price to clients is more competitive. Secondly, it can lead to market unfairness if international companies become stronger. Giant global firms develop their business in different areas, and they can take an unfair advantage to win more clients through their close relationships with governments and counterparties. For instance, some big international banks obtain some proficient policies from local governments by providing senior positions to some public officers’ relatives.

On the other hand, I stand with these people who believe that it is a positive development that global firms are increasingly powerful. Help boost the local economy and widen people’s version of the world. Global big firms provide a large number of job opportunities to people who are located in different countries. For instance, people from developing countries can learn technical skills from their jobs in big companies and increase their professional knowledge through job training. People who work in international corporations need to collaborate with colleagues from different backgrounds and nationalities, and they can be more open-minded by communicating and cooperating with different people. Furthermore, these people can utilize their international working experiences to assist local companies’ growth.

In conclusion, although the growth of international companies can have a negative impact on the development of local business and market fairness, I believe that it is positive progress because international companies aid in resolving the unemployment issue and widen people’s version of the world.

#development","Migration of people is a widespread phenomenon throughout the world and is usually associated with concomitant problems.The rural population around the world in many countries is decreasing since people are moving to neighbouring cities, causing significant changes of previously unseen proportions. In my opinion, people moving out of rural areas is a negative development and this essay will present arguments demonstrating the same.

Firstly, the major negative impact is on the overall rural economy, predominantly on farming as the folk required for this activity will be inadequate. For example, the extent of  farming produced is reduced drastically because of the shortfall in labour which will accumulate year by year and become unsurmountable.The outcome of the spending power for the remnant will make living in rural areas unviable.

Another bleak outcome is sociological in nature because migrations to urban areas are undertaken by younger men and women, leading to a predominance of senior citizens who are left behind to manage household affairs. More often than not this leads to a weak and helpless community who cannot do more than the bare minimum maintenance tasks. As a result, facilities in the countryside, like parks, hospitals, schools, roads etc become rundown and look poverty-stricken. 

To summarize, the problem of the countryside being depleted of population due to migration is harmful to that part of any nation and has to be rectified. In the above paragraphs, we have seen two such issues out of many more possible deteriorating outcomes and we can conclude that unless there is a concerted intervention by the governments of various countries, the problems of  the countryside will be exacerbated.

Admittedly, the disappearance of certain animals such as dinosaurs and dodos is considered natural because it occurs without direct human influence, like asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions, so it cannot be prevented. However, I am convinced that it remains our responsibility to prevent this phenomenon from happening. Specifically, there is no denying that human activities, such as deforestation and industrial pollution, have led to habitat loss and pollution, which are the primary reasons for animal extinction. Since humans are the drivers of ecological destruction, it is their duty to ensure animals’ existence. By doing so, we are not only fulfilling our moral duty toward nature, but we are also helping create a planet full of diversity for future generations to appreciate.

In addition, apart from fulfilling our ethical responsibility, I am sure that our efforts to halt animals’ death may open new avenues for scientific discoveries, which could bring immense benefits to mankind. For instance, the Sumatran Orangutan, a highly endangered species today, is worth protecting. If we ignore them, we will not be able to utilize them when conducting scientific research involving evolution and genetics. When this happens, understanding their close genetic relationship with humans as well as the possibility of scientific breakthroughs like cloning or medical advancements will not be possible.

In conclusion, although I find it admissible that certain animals no longer exist due to natural reasons, we must still recognize our ethical responsibility and animals’ potential contributions to scientific discovery, so we should exert more effort on protecting them than neglecting them.

#healthcare","Nowadays, healthcare is one of the most essential things in the world. Some people believe that their health depends on suggestions from doctors, so they do not keep their good physical condition by themselves. Although there are several problems, there will be a variety of possible solutions to overcome them.

The first aspect to identify is that the cost of health will increase if society only depends on the doctor. In fact, medical costs in some countries are exceedingly high and all poor communities do not have access to adequate treatment even if they need it. consequently, the number of deaths will grow in some countries. Another important issue is that if all patients who have mild illnesses are hospitalized due to a lack of independent care at home, therefore the availability of hospital beds for nations who need fast immediate care will decrease. Those phenomena could have a small group of negative impacts on association in terms of equality of opportunities and medical care. 

even though these two problems may be unavoidable, there are various solutions for them. Firstly, the civilizations need to be educated on how to maintain their good physical condition day-to-day. For example, TV shows have an enormous impact because everyone watches them in the house. If there are a number of educational programs related to well-being and physical fitness, an individual would learn how to change the daily habit of eating to keep away from the problem of healthiness. Secondly, the government must give an opportunity to humanity to increase their welfare at local facilities. For instance, in Japan, there are a few educational meetings at local facilities given to the public on how to avoid obesity or how to maintain good conditions during pregnancy. 

In conclusion, there are several problems in society if people are very dependent on doctors regarding the cost of treatment and the availability of beds in hospitals, but several solutions to overcome this negative trend. If the government tries to educate the public about the importance of maintaining physical health, then this problem will be resolved.

This has led to the division of society into 2 groups: those who believe that these changes are beneficial in many ways, while others are worried about our dependence on innovations. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and share my outlook.

           It is true that people are gradually losing control over their lifestyle to technology. One of the reasons is an addiction to social media. Although it takes little time to watch one video or read a post, algorithms will recommend the ones that we might like the most, resulting in constant scrolling over hours. For instance, some teenagers find themselves consuming content past their bedtime, causing a reduction in time spent on sleeping and, consequently, health and productivity issues. Moreover, humanity has learned to store many pieces of data that otherwise we would have to remember by ourselves. For example, previously, if a person would want to go home with a taxi they would need to have their home address remembered, while now an application on a smartphone already has that information written on its memory. This can potentially lead to the degradation of the brain's abilities to memorise and not forget. 

      On the other hand, despite some disadvantages, I agree with the positive view of advancement. In particular possibility to work, shop and study anywhere as long as there is a connection to the internet, which can free an office worker from the stress and time wastage that comes with commuting or queuing in shops which can be reattributed towards having a rest, taking care of family and other things that can make a person happy. Besides, it helps us to learn and study without having to travel to attend lectures, thus making education more affordable.

        In conclusion, even though both opinions are relevant, I believe that technology is mostly making our lives more enjoyable. Drawbacks that were mentioned above, can be dealt with if an effort is made by an individual.

In my view of thinking, interacting socially with work colleagues is good for making a workplace a happy place. However, sometimes being over-friendly with fellow staff creates some ethical issues with the disciplinary guidelines of the organisation.

On the one hand, making some good friends makes our lives easy in many aspects. Specifically, at offices, where many individuals spend their duty hours of the day, we need a stress-free environment. Therefore, it is a good step to socialise with our subordinates during possible hours like evenings or weekends. Good tuning between the job team is always beneficial for the outcome they produce, A TV9 survey in March 2023, for instance, proved that the social interaction between officemates is useful for boosting  the quality of tasks they do together.

On the other hand, some issues related to mingling with company colleagues have been reported at many organisations. To be more specific, over-friendly relations between officemates may cause the likelihood of favouring someone all the time regardless of his/her capabilities over other hard-working fellow staff. Moreover, few employees may pressure their managers for benefits such as salary hikes, promotions or ease of  duty. Hence, it is said that work-life must not get mixed up with our regular life. For example, in my first company, a senior manager was fired from his position on account of favouring his friend for onsite opportunities.

To conclude, admittedly, an office place should be a happening place to produce more and more quality outcomes and this can be achieved through bonding well with colleagues regularly. Still, there are some risks associated with it if not kept within limits.

#people
#money","Lacking  money is an issue for some, which leads to the opinion that the sole purpose behind working diligently is to earn more money. I totally disagree with this notion and will give my rationale in this discussion. 

Having financial issues could decrease the quality of life, which contributes to someone working harder than others to fulfil their basic needs. Take the financial recession in 2008 as an example, many people lost their jobs and their homes which consequently made people work harder and make more money to sustain their normal needs. Or if a member of a middle-class family was diagnosed with a terminal health problem, in order to pay for the long-term treatment, someone in the family potentially needs to double their time of work to earn more money. Therefore, some do have the need to devote more time and energy working to make extra cash, not with the sole purpose of making a lot of money but in order to cover their needs. 

Another reason  why some focus on work more than others is because they have a mission. Take ultra-marathon runner and Ex-Navy SEAL David Goggins as an example, he was able to participate in the world's most challenging marathon to date and actually finished it with record timing. In order to achieve such a feat, he worked very diligently on himself and with his mission backing him up which was raising money. Moreover, the funding he received from the marathon was not for himself but for providing for the families of his fallen comrades in the Navy while on active duty. Thus, there are higher purposes to push someone to focus on their job, career or mission. 

In conclusion, earning more monetary possessions is not the only reason for a person to work harder but there are other purposes that motivate someone to do so.

For instance, my house is more than 50 years old and was built when my grandmother was still a kid. It contains the memories from three generations including me, my parents and my grandparents. Every room always reminds me of a certain memory, making me remember my root
 and who I am. This kind of feeling is so treasured and no amount of money is too expensive for this.

Furthermore, old buildings have a cultural value that can be used to showcase their history. For example, there are several old buildings in my country that are being restored and transformed into museums such as Fatahillah, a museum that was built when the Dutch ruled my country. Fatahillah Museum now become the main destination for students to learn about the history, culture and architectural aspects of when Indonesia was still ruled by the Dutch, a hundred years ago. This kind of experience is meaningful and will not happen if old buildings are destroyed.

In conclusion, I do believe that old buildings have a special value. Repairing and looking after them is worth the price, hence we should not knock down the old building nor replace them with a modern one.

Although almost all people are fond of working for popular and big corporates, it is sensible that at the initial stages after graduation, graduates seek jobs at small-size companies.

To begin with, some merits of small association for being employed are presented. As a small community, colleagues and superiors at small workplaces can dedicate more time to a new commer  owing to the flat structure of organizational charts or the few levels of hierarchies. Thus, this close relationship often enables students to learn more after graduation and be guided directly by top managers. Hence, the more skills and qualifications that those graduates gain, the more likely their advancement of career path will be. Moreover, rarely can we find a small business where employees do not face a wide range of experiences lacking the recruitment possibility for each problem which has occurred. Therefore, after working for such companies, individuals will get valuable and multi-fascinated knowledge which equips them for further success. 

However, popular companies provide considerable incentives and facilities for their staff so that it is more likely for them to advance professionally. Besides, funding for innovative suggestions is nothing new in large-scale sectors. In terms of mental and emotional aspects, being proud of accomplishing successful tasks in such an enterprise, gives a feeling of self-confidence to staff.

To conclude, nobody can claim that recruitment in a big size enterprise provides the path for rising through the rank in terms of financial support and being stable, but a graduated person who has worked for a small business and learned well enough and then applied for a bigger company is more suitable career road map so that this multi-discipline and knowledgeable person can advance more easily when applying for a bigger company following working a while for a smaller one.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"#educators
#child
#instrument","Some educators hold a belief that all children should learn to play a certain musical instrument. Despite the disadvantages associated with students' hectic schedules, I believe that this approach is a good way to discover young musical talents and provide healthy pastimes for youngsters.

On the one hand, it is undoubtedly that students are likely to suffer more pressure when musical subjects are added to the educational program. This is because this approach adds more stress to the already burdensome volume of schoolwork. In fact, students nowadays are often subjected to a busy schedule with a mounting of homework and in-class assignments. Therefore, adding another subject to their curriculum can make it more difficult for children to study effectively. The situation even gets worse if a child feels frustrated and no longer excited about learning music. They must be better off using that effort and time to focus on something which they are really interested in.

On the other hand, it is understandable that learning music is believed to be beneficial for youngsters. Firstly, geniuses' musical talent can be discovered at a young age and later developed into a professional career. Dang Thai Son, who learnt the piano from his mother at the age of 6 and became the most Vietnamese successful pianist is an excellent example. Secondly, in the eyes of adults, learning to play music is a positive hobby and potentially replaces computer games. These days, teenagers spend most of their time watching mind-numbing television programs and playing digital games. Studies show that spending too much time on video games can produce behavioural and mental changes, leading to a lack of other activities and poor academic performance. Meanwhile, playing music can improve students' verbal memory, spatial reasoning and literacy skills. The main reason is that playing music involves both sides of the brain which strengthens memorial skills.

In conclusion, while learning to play a musical instrument can bring certain benefits to young people in terms of the discovery of young musical talents and organizing healthy pastimes, it is important to acknowledge its drawbacks such as increased pressure. It is advisable that musical education should be provided to students who are really interested in and willing to pursue it rather than imposing it on all children.

Discuss both views and state your opinion.,"#money
#time","Some say that earning important quantities of cash as well as having fewer intervals of leisure is better than having less money with more free time. This essay will suggest that owning loads of it is necessary in order to have quality relaxation periods and having more spare time allows you to feel, overall, more relaxed. 

It is thought that  thanks to having a large capital, individuals can enjoy the small amount of it they have. Furthermore, when having a lot of money, people are able to book extravagant trips to foreign countries and live countless and luxurious experiences. For instance, my uncle has only 2 weeks per year of vacation because he spends all of his hours working towards building an empire. Though he might seem tortured, he is one of the happiest men alive as a consequence of how perfectly he manages those two weeks and creates unforgettable memories with the cash he owns.

People also believe that money is not a crucial factor in having the knowledge of how to spend a free stretch. Moreover, it is possible to enjoy most of life with not much in capital since having a pleasure in life is accessible to everyone. For example, in the 2023 annual Harvard Social study, the results illustrated that  all in all, individuals with less cash were happier than those possessing a lot of it. Between the first category, 50% explained that their happiness was due to the simple yet qualitative life they have thanks to the important amount of leisure periods. 

To conclude, I personally think that having an important capital with little relaxation time is better than the opposite since it is possible to know how to organise these small periods of leisure in order to enjoy the most of it.

Whilst certain individuals claim that splurging money on libraries is a waste of resources, others contend the notion that new emerging technologies are capable of being a plausible substitute for libraries. It is my notion that although advancements in technology can furnish readers with the digitalized version of books, it is the environment and preservation of certain ancient books that cannot be replicated by technology.

First and foremost, as we live on the edge of technology, people should be more reluctant to head towards digitalized and more environmentally-friendly options when it comes to reading books in libraries. Now that many breakthrough inventions accomplished in this era, readers can now have  access to the rarest readings and books in the world through numerous websites and online libraries. Countries and universities that are spending millions of dollars each year to maintain libraries can basically switch to  digitalized solutions, therefore, decreasing the operation expenses and diverting the resulting funds towards other shortcomings of  society and students. For example, universities all across the world now closing their libraries and establishing  centralized information management servers where readers can freely benefit from the resources available from the comfort of home. 

On the contrary side, libraries have always been a cultural centre for many societies, encompassing historical information and artefacts that are worth beyond the monetary valuation. It should be underlined that restoring or keeping these libraries in pristine condition is a challenging work which necessitates  well-planned coordination and financial resources. Furthermore, the one thing that is impossible to create in an artificial environment is the ambience in these old libraries where you can almost travel back in time to feel these time periods through the centuries-old buildings and books that have been well taken care of.  To exemplify this statement, the Egypt government spends thousands of dollars each year to preserve and maintain the condition of one of the oldest libraries in the world, known as the Library of Alexandria.

In conclusion, despite digitalized libraries being a more economically advantageous and pragmatic solution compared to physical ones, there are some properties such as historical importance.

From my perspective, this statement is the result of upgraded technological devices that the companies are providing for individuals. Although I find this statement to be an extremely negative development for various reasons.

With a comparison between the way of communication by the last generations and nowadays, virtual communication is becoming more and more popular every day, as people tend to show more interest in this way of talking to others and this made the path for these technology companies to provide and upgrade their devices. As a result, most children are showing more interest in using them than before. Nowadays, a great number of kids own their own smartphones and mostly are using them to communicate with their friends through them which causes them to waste a significantly greater amount of their time to be involved in their friend's community and not be left behind. Smartphones are now an inseparable part of adolescents' lives. These devices, moreover, consist of some interesting features such as the capability of watching movies, playing video games, and reading e-books which seem mesmerising to many youngsters and grab their attention to spend hours on their phones. 

In my opinion, this statement has various drawbacks. Firstly, it is extremely time-consuming as children may find themselves scrolling through social media for many hours without any reason which will take their time that has to be spent outside of the house playing with their friends and doing homework. On the contrary, the blue light of these devices will eventually have a damaging effect on their brain and their ability to think properly, as well as their ability to solve problems and deal with difficulties. This statement, furthermore, may lead youngsters to become unsociable and depressed over time. For instance, if a child only speaks to his friends through texting them, he would not be able to express his ideas clearly when it comes to face-to-face communication, which will make him depressed and anxious.

To sum up, to me, that is a horrible decision to let the kids use their phones as much as they want to since this will bring a variety of unforgettable damages while they are growing up, as this is the time when their brains are forming and can have huge drawbacks to their future.

#qualification","The majority of university students opt for learning various fields as well as their major while others believe paying attention solely to their qualification is more crucial. This essay will discuss both views and suggest my opinion in favour of the latter.

On the one hand, focusing and doing one's utmost to qualify is considerable as it leads to profound education. To be specific, the more students concentrate on their fields, the more they are exposed to higher-quality knowledge and information. For example, a student who spends 10,000 hours reading a biology thesis is likely to understand the lecture and the textbooks easily compared to others who only studied for 1000 hours and learned other subjects. Thus, concentrating on their subject only and studying hard for their qualification often result in excelling and obtaining a deep knowledge in their fields. 

On the other hand, seeking various subjects in addition to their department enables people to experience various studies and to broaden their insight. Furthermore, studying a wide range of fields leads to flexible perspectives. For instance, people who learn Korean literature, social science, and biology will effectively comprehend social, environmental, and gender disparity issues as they have widened their knowledge and understanding. Hence, learning many subjects helps individuals to cultivate multi-abilities and deter them from having narrow perspectives. 

However, in my view, I believe that doing one's best and endeavouring to a qualification is needed since I highly benefit from obtaining my master's degree. I was able to learn an in-depth section of law, which is my major. Also, I found a job with a high salary and work-life balance. It was possible because I was more outstanding than other applicants as I studied further and harder. In conclusion, although some individuals think that studying different departments is favourable, I stress that solely focusing on qualifying is crucial.

However,  the loss of flora and fauna is due to human activity to explore businesses and companies so they have to do deforestation of this many plants are lost. The plant is a good source of oxygen, if continued deforestation occurs it will lead to serious consequences. Apart from, animals play a vital role in human life, if they also low extinct it is an environmental problem because it finishes the one Kingdom of species. For instance, building a factory of plastic bottles of tree cuts, and the garbage from industries returned by pets, and lost both species.

Moreover, pollution is a major environmental problem that leads to many health-related problems, especially for children and old age groups. Additionally, climate change occurs because of the greenhouse effect and as a result, the melting of glaciers and variation of seasons occur many other factors like global warming, water scarcity, and ozone depletion leading to ecological problems.

To conclude, some claim that the extinction of specific plants and animals is the primary environmental issue facing over time, and some claim that there are more pressing ecological concepts.

Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether concentrating on qualifying in merely main subjects or pursuing some other related knowledge. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, in this essay I would contend that gaining as much information as possible related to the main subjects is more advisable. Two primary reasons for this are as follows.

First of all, it is an indisputable fact that extending the horizon of knowledge could play a complementary role in fulfilling the future profession. According to my own experiences, a salient example of this could be learning Python programming language  geographic information systems and remote sensing students at universities, which can broaden their analytical skills in processing satellite images. So, rather than concentrating on the main subjects, learning about other subjects is likely to be more constructive in the future job.

Secondly and even more importantly, though, is the fact that focusing  solely on the issue is likely to be insufficient as the pace of life increases significantly. For instance, having a grasp of psychological principles could provide a better company for doctors with their patients which, would climb the process of treatment. So, having grown up in a technology era, insisting on such a limited attitude would result in unsatisfying consequences.  

By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that although studying for a qualification would lead to being an expert in a future job, spending time learning related subjects would be accompanied by significant advantages for the betterment of societies.

#men","The trend of full-time labour among women has created a balance of chores and responsibilities with their spouses. Personally, I am completely in the same boat with this notion. This phenomenon can lessen the degree of patriarchalism and reduce the fatherless issue in a family. I will try to explain both benefits based on the condition of my country, Indonesia.

A current shift where mothers can achieve the same career opportunities as men might diminish the effect of patriarchism. It is a belief that exists in many regions, and consistently puts males as the top priority in any relations. To illustrate, in the early 1900s in Indonesia, females are entitled only to three places with three duties. Kitchen for cooking, bed for mating, and well for house working. However, since girls are able to enter the workforce, a lot has changed. Those who previously held patriarchy and overshadowed women all the time already realized that women are as capable as men. Thus, if initially, mothers were the only ones to handle housework, then nowadays fathers should be able to do it equally.

On the other hand, this alteration has the likelihood to alleviate the troublesome fatherless problems. As its name implies, fatherless means the lack of involvement or dad figure in daily life. Usually ensued as the breadwinner image being invoked on males. For example, a job can take up to 8 to 9 hours per day. It is true that from this, a husband can fulfil the financial needs of his youngsters. Nevertheless, it is also a hard pill to swallow that he will not have sufficient time to play with the children. Therefore, the psychological void will emerge within them. Fortunately,  modern belief has countered it, hence men can spend more moments with their sons or daughters. A family's income is not confined to one source anymore.

Overall, once again, I am fully aligned with this concept. Two benefits have evidently been generated since females have  even-handed circumstances with their spouses at work. The social issue of patriarchy and fatherless parents can be lowered. In the future, I assume that this lifestyle will be proliferated in more countries. The advantages are really invaluable.

Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people.","#countries

#governments
#society","The debate surrounding an ageing population has garnered considerable attention globally, with opinions sharply divided. On one hand, an ageing demographic is perceived as a challenge for governments; on the other, it is seen as a societal asset. This essay posits that the benefits brought by an elderly populace significantly outweigh the drawbacks, given their wealth of experience and continued economic contributions.

Firstly, senior citizens are invaluable repositories of wisdom and experience, which they impart to younger generations. Their perspectives, shaped by years of diverse experiences, are crucial in guiding the youth and in policy formulation. Take, for instance, their role in shaping historical consciousness — many elders lived through pivotal events, such as the technological boom or significant political upheavals. Their firsthand accounts and insights are irreplaceable, ensuring that lessons from the past are not just remembered but integrated into current societal norms and decision-making processes. This intergenerational exchange fosters a society that is well-grounded in its history and more resilient to future challenges.

Moreover, contrary to the belief that retirees are a strain on economic resources, many continue to contribute actively to the workforce. In countries like Japan, where the ageing population is notably high, older workers are not just participating but are essential in addressing labour shortages. Their presence in various sectors brings a balance of skills and perspectives, often leading to more innovative and empathetic workplace cultures. Additionally, their mentorship roles in organizations enhance knowledge transfer, ensuring business continuity and growth.

In conclusion, though the phenomenon of people living longer than ever before is posing some challenges, these are far outweighed by the societal contributions made by the elderly.

#estatement","Owing to the rapid growth of research and innovation in science, it is believed that the aim of science is to ameliorate living standards in society. I completely agree that scientific discoveries and technological inventions should be solutions for any problems human beings may be or are currently facing in order to have a much better life. 

To begin with, numerous inventions since the past have directly contributed to humankind and provided an easier life in the modern age. These inventions come in a variety of domains ranging from the health sector to telecommunications. Telephones invented by Alexander Graham Bell, for instance, have altered the way pupils communicate as the technology allows them to have two-way immediate conversations despite distance. Furthermore, the form and function of telephones have evolved exponentially as mobile phones nowadays are multifunctional with a wide range of activities accommodated, including internet and social media access. 

In addition, fostering and accelerating the betterment of human lives through scientific efforts are actually the responsibility of scientists. They carry an enormous obligation to put their knowledge and expertise into service for the greater good, especially since human beings keep on witnessing challenges such as climate change, potential global or wide-scale infectious diseases, and poverty. One perfect example was the development of COVID-19 vaccines that involved a substantial number of scientists worldwide joining forces. It was proof of their commitment to saving lives and the way to showcase the immense influence of science during a humanitarian crisis. 

To sum up, scientific exploration, in fact, possesses multiple aims. However, the aim of enhancing people’s lives is undoubtedly the central mission as more and more discoveries and innovations ease people in doing their activities as well as it is an obligation for the scientific community.

While many people think that air and water pollution can be alleviated if the government expands the charges on numerous industrial areas, I agree with those who argue that other superior methods could be adopted to solve this problem. 

On the one hand, it is justified why some people advocate the view that paying extra charges might help to tackle the problem of pollution. To begin with, the quality of air and water resources could be improved considerably thanks to the punishment of paying a heavy tax. It is undeniable that the factories may release a myriad of harmful chemicals in plastic-making processes and clothing into the rivers which can put the marine ecosystem at a disadvantage to be able to exist. Therefore, the government is in charge of introducing the law such as paying the fine to the industries so that they will discharge fewer unused materials outside the environment.

On the other hand, I contend that several further outcomes can be implemented to improve the situation. Firstly, the authorities should encourage the factories to put more resources into the water treatment system. Using this system to deal with harmful waste before dumping it into the rivers can minimize the negative effects on the natural habitat. In addition, there is a need for factories to recycle as much as possible. This is perfectly exemplified in the case of putting advanced technology into practice so as to reduce wastes including unused wool and chemicals, and, use organic materials as a fuel replacement.

In conclusion, there are many benefits regarding increasing taxes on the industries, whereas, I believe that it is more beneficial to adopt other alternative measures.

It seems that this kind of voluntary job exerts a positive effect on teenager’s character. In addition, they can earn work experience through this involvement.

It is undeniable that making a responsible character is one of the most challenging issues in the modern world. In this regard, the educational system should not only focus on the pursuit of knowledge but also the development of good personality such as being patient, caring, and responsible. It should be noted that students might learn these skills in the classroom but would not have the chance to apply or practice them. However, interaction with people in community service allows them to build up those morals. It brings that knowledge of morality into experience in their life. for instance, helping orphans makes a contribution to earning social skills.

Moreover, it is very competitive in applying to universities or jobs. Universities prefer influential students to adopt. For example, MIT University receives more than thousands of new applications each year. Most applicants obtained all A’s results, so it is not easy to select the new intake students. At that time, their contribution to the community would make them distinguished among the applicants. 

To sum up, without a shadow of a doubt, involvement in unpaid community service brings great benefits to shape the morality of teenagers and boost their chances of getting into tertiary education. So I totally agree with the idea that unpaid work should be included in school programs.

For instance, healthcare, education and public goods and services. Some say taxation is a big enough contribution to a nation, meanwhile, others think that human beings do have more duties as a part of association rather than only paying tariffs. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall explain my point of view.

In my opinion, I strongly concur with those who argue that the population should take more obligations such as volunteering, obeying laws and donating money or necessary stuff to the crowd who live in poor conditions. In contrast, if some individuals create hazardous situations or are against the rules of the nation, that would require the state to spend an amount  more money to take care of it.

Some believe that the government already takes responsibility and does its best in duties. They invest in the development of industries, public infrastructure, better citizen welfare, as well as vital military equipment. On the other hand, there are other obligations other than cash as taxes for residents. For example, during the pandemic COVID-19 everyone had to follow the social-distancing rules strictly, due to the situation being out of hand with the nation at that time.

In a nutshell, paying fines is a civic duty which the community must do to improve a country, but other than that there are moral behaviours which enhance a better social life and peace.

Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?","#countries

#development","With the advancement of urban developments, a growing rate of young adults from suburbs move to cities, seeking better employment. This leads to an imbalanced population between rural and urban areas. Some argue that this brings a positive impact on the country as a whole, while I believe that there are substantial negative consequences.

Looking at the upsides of the moving population from the countryside, cities provide rural residents with greater resources and better future development. For example, urban areas are building an increasing number of business locations, housing sections and all kinds of construction, which requires a significant amount of workers. By contrast, suburbs lack a variety of occupations, and most of the residents there engage in more conventional work. People are seeking various opportunities to raise per capita income and improve life quality. Consequently, increasing numbers of employers from all sectors enhance productivity and therefore boost the economic growth of a country as a whole.

However, the major drawbacks of a declining rural population can increase the urban-rural gap and result in unequal distribution of wealth. For instance, less labour force is devoted to traditional industries such as agriculture, farming or manufacturing, reducing the production of the primary sector and dramatically affecting the cost of those raw products. Furthermore, those who suffer from a production decline can result in a substantial reduction in their earnings, making the urban-rural gap far more severe.

In conclusion, although every country may experience this issue inevitably, we must take action on how to alleviate the challenges our countryside is facing and make adjustments to tackle the matters of decreasing labour force and revenues in the countryside.

#development","Nowadays, some kids can mindlessly scroll through their smartphones for hours on a daily basis. This phenomenon is happening due to the lack of care from families. Overall, I firmly disagree with this contemporary habit as it has a degrading impact on children's ability to focus and social skills.

To begin with, the main contributor to this issue is the parents' ignorance of their heirs. To illustrate, many working parents spend most of their time outside of the house, thus, over-rely on the babysitter's role to take care of their offspring. Hence, the easiest way to soothe toddlers is by introducing them to consuming content on smartphones. For instance, I often watch mothers giving out gadgets as a shortcut to calm their toddlers every time I eat out at a restaurant. This kind of negligence builds the children's overdependent behaviour to gadgets.

From my point of view, this habit is destructive to the toddlers' development. Firstly, children will become addicted to the sudden endorphin rush gotten from entertainment and, consequently, weaken their concentration capability from such an early age. For example, my 5-year-old nephew found it hard to recall his own address because of his outrageous addiction to computer games. Moreover, kids will not be exploring avenues outside their comfort zone and making new friends that build their social intelligence.

In conclusion, families play a monumental role in overcoming the issue of the era. As the drawbacks of playing smartphones have undeniably detrimental impacts on children, I strongly opine that this is a negative development. It would be nice if kids nowadays could also chase butterflies together with their pals like our generation used to enjoy in hindsight.

If we compare its bad and good sides of course it has  a lot of benefits. İ do not believe it affects us  in a bad way.  This essay will try to explain why people think it brings  more problems.

On the one hand, if humans did not find  a lot of tools, would we eat food with our hands like animals? Moreover,  if we did not invent a lot of machines like cars, planes or trains maybe we would go from Turkey to Germany but it would take a week. However, this distance is just three hours by plane now. For example, 20 years ago many people were not good at communicating with relatives or their family who lived abroad  while developing the internet, lots of humans can speak with relatives through video conferences today thanks to innovations.

On the other hand, in the past, humans had  good relationships, most people used to visit their relatives and kids played in the street. Unfortunately, technology has developed and the old relations are gone. In addition,  most children depend on computers or telephones that's why their eyes get ill. For instance, my friend's son is 6 years old. although he is young, he has health situations due to using the telephone every day.

Nowadays, we all are living in the modern era where every culture and tradition slightly changed this refers to the illustrations of evolution in our society. The statement said that student should get their attention on all education topics personally speaking, I don't think it is significant for teenagers. As I am a younger generation, I truly understand why many parents want their children to learn all fields.,Nonetheless we should abolish this notion as our world has developed. Hence, we should let them study all of the core subjects just for the foundation knowledge and if they find it  interesting you can let them research more.

According to many younger generations, they are more interested in studying what topic they are concerned about which is more efficient than examining all topics. Subsequently, if they are strongly attracted to any subject they could do it effectively and that might provide them with an opportunity to shine their potential in the future. Apart from that, as I have experienced , it is more delightful for me to spend my time studying what I am genuinely concerned about. That is the reason why many youths tend to concentrate more on what they are fascinated by.

Some society members are of the opinion that we should not worry about the future but live in the present and take joy in life instead.I Partially agree with this opinion due to the reasons which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, there is a famous line that says ""live in the moment"" so lots of folks want to follow that because they do not know what  tomorrow will bring. Focusing on the forthcoming years and having a plan for it put people under lots of pressure. For example, when individuals program their lifetime they have to work hard   to make plenty of money and reach their goals and consequently,they may have to face lots of anxiety.

On the other hand, having a policy will ensure your future as well as your family's. If you have a long-term plan when you face  difficulties, you do not worry because you have considered all the possibilities and you will overcome that problem. For instance, a lot of community members these days are investing in the stock market not only for themselves but also for their families and children  so that they can have a secure prospective time and prepare themselves for a rainy day.

I strongly disagree with this perspective, as it is predominant for an individual to be aware of the facts behind every concept. This essay elaborates on the reason in the following paragraphs with relevant examples.

To begin with, There is a myth growing among youngsters of the current generation that is necessary for them to understand their syllabus without recognizing the benefits that renders to our society. Subsequently, they are more concentrated on improving their grades to win over their competitors. However, in a real sense, it is controversial to believe that, despite focusing only on subjects, it is advisable to know about its real-time implementation. To give a good example, university students can bring up innovative applications by applying their theories in a practical world. Thereby, this kind of study method results in an upward trend in developing countries. 

In addition, students who concentrate on the development process instead of producing documentary context would be fond of a multitude of opportunities to prove themselves in a self-desired place that makes them feel gratified. For instance, people who are inclined to produce appealing products based on applied math and science which satisfy the public requirements, would help to grow an uptrend graph toward their longed designation.

To sum up, It is good to gain practical insights through their educational process to enrich the self and social existence.

#trend","Taking a gap year off between finishing school and starting university has gained popularity in recent years. Moreover, the trend comes with several pros and cons worth considering. In my opinion, I believe that the benefit for students is to grow their personal development and career exploration, however, there are some detriments due to this delay that may impact study habits and affect long-term career goals.

Many people support a period after high school as it can generate a wide range of benefits for adolescents. Those who give themselves a break between high school and university potentially could gain their personal growth as well as work experience. For example, it allows young adults to explore their interests and passions, together with the chance to gain work experience in their chosen field, providing insight into their future goals. Another thing worth pointing out is that it is the perfect time to improve academic performance and broaden your horizons, which could be by travelling to another country.

Nevertheless, large fractions of individuals argue that if students stay away from the educational environment for roughly a period of time, it will result in a delayed graduation. In the long, run they might be behind their peers in career progression. In addition, they may lose interest in studying, such as, if they have a chance to earn sufficient money they will not come back to the educational environment. 

To sum up, there are strong arguments on both sides. Whereas the significance of resuming academic education is undeniable, teenagers who have undergone multiple pressures need to unwind before starting university. Therefore, I strongly believe that the superiorities of a year gap outnumber its downsides.

Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children.

What are its causes, and what solutions can be offered?","#children

#disease","Being obese was once only a condition that adults suffered from, but it is becoming more common in youths. This essay will first discuss how fast food and a sedentary lifestyle are the primary causes of this growing problem and then outline how education and increased exercise are the most viable solutions.

One cause of obesity in youngsters is the increasing popularity of fast-food restaurants. Fast food usually contains an exorbitant number of calories because it is very high in fat and sugar. In addition, young people are living a more sedentary lifestyle. Nowadays, more adolescents choose computer games or social media over physical activity, so they are unable to burn the extra calories they are eating. It can be commonly seen in many Western nations, for instance, that the number of youth who participate in after-school sports has dropped significantly over the last decade.

The best solution to this problem of being overweight is to educate adolescents about the dangers of being severely overweight. If children are more aware of the types of diseases associated with chubbiness, they might think twice before asking their parents to take them to the local burger restaurant. Moreover, schools should introduce more exercise into their curriculums. If youngsters take part in sports, the physical activity will allow them to burn calories and avoid weight gain. Schools where youths are required to participate in at least one team sport, for example, typically have lower obesity rates.

In conclusion, many children are struggling with their weight because of eating too much junk food combined with a sedentary lifestyle. However, if schools give adolescents enough information about the risks they are taking by doing this and require children to do more exercise, the problem can be alleviated.

Although some believe that old citizens should save money for their future lives, others criticize this and argue that the government should offer financial support and care to them. The two sides of this argument will be thoroughly discussed and analyzed in the essay before drawing a reasoned conclusion. 

On the one hand, there are some demerits associated with offering money to senior persons. First and foremost is the lack of financial management in some groups. To explain, aged individuals should prepare themself for their payments after retirement. For instance, hospital and doctor fees are a large number of expenses from all bills. Thus, If old people can take care of themself without support from the government, we can manage taxes to develop other pain points in the country which are transportation, health care, education, and others. 

On the other hand, there are several merits of this funding. The principal merit is youngsters and offspring can save their money from their parent's monthly expenses. In other words, they can purchase anything that they want so the country's economy will grow significantly. Moreover, their parents can look after themself so they have more time to focus on their work or businesses.

To summarise, the two points of view of the argument concerning financial support to old people. I am of the opinion that the government should appropriately offer this money to them because it indirectly helps their economy.

#politicians
#times","The question of whether the authority should always be straightforward is a critical concern for citizens, often rooted in a deep-seated desire to safeguard the integrity and strength of the nation. In my opinion, the government should prioritize honesty to the people.

On the one hand, there are instances where the head of a country may need to withhold certain information from the public. For example, intelligence data could pose significant threats to a nation, especially when governmental leaders are negotiating with other countries.  Thus, keeping certain information classified will maintain an advantageous position in parleys or protect national security. Furthermore, restraining negative news related to societal and economic issues could help the country survive the crisis. Some people consider this a good measure to prevent mass panic and instability in the community.

On the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that national authority should act as a role model of ethical standards to citizens.  A nation thrives on the trustworthiness and accountability of its governmental body. As a result, members of a society are inspired to act ethically in their own lives, leading to a more cohesive and compassionate community. Moreover, when leaders consistently live up to their promises, they communicate confidence in their actions and decisions to global politics. This trust will help build a healthy relationship with other countries. For instance, when Canada apologized for its violence against native people, the country gained credibility among its own citizens and a positive image on the international stage.

In conclusion, I believe that it is necessary for politicians to be truthful when addressing the public.

This essay agrees that individuals now get  information about the world and read books on the Internet without paying any fund 

To begin with, it is relatively cheap and convenient to get material online. This is because one does not have to travel and spend a lot of money before one gets information. With a little cash and a click on their phone or laptop, they get an array of news around the world, as well as more options of novels to read without stressing themselves. For example, a 2013 study from Cambridge University showed that 80% of citizens prefer reading on their phones and laptops.

Moreover, online publication is cheap. In other words, it is cost-effective to publish information online since no fund is needed to purchase paper, ensure quality info is printed out, also travel for distribution. With online one can sit in the comfort of his home and post information on social media and can be seen all around the world. For instance, research conducted in 2014 indicated that hundreds of people spent hours on social media just trying to catch up with the trending news.

#support","The young adult proponents seek independence from their household as early as possible whereas the opponents fancy staying at their parent's house for a longer period. I believe that living under the same roof with your family has some advantages. 

First of all, being housed together will save you a bunch of daily expenses such as rent, utilities, and food. Instead of spending your hard-earned money on these necessities, you could invest it in asset classes like stocks and mutual funds in order to grow your wealth faster. On average, financial experts estimate that costs consist of approximately half of someone's income, especially during this season of price inflation. Thus, shamelessly downgrading your life with your parents' providence will help you soar financially. 

Secondly, you can also build a more favourable kinship with your household members through day-to-day interactions and activities. A nurturing and supportive relationship is greatly impactful to young adults' views in life and performance at work. My best friend who bonds well with her siblings tends to be more cheerful and demonstrates positive behaviour towards others. At the end of the day, it's only the family who is willing to help you at your worst as blood is thicker than water. However, I do understand that not everyone was lucky enough to be born in a providing and warm household. Sometimes unexpected and poignant miseries happened like divorce and bankruptcy. 

As someone with a broken family, living with either my mother or my father comes at the cost of my mental health and peace of mind. For this reason, part of me can relate to young adults who demand independence over their lives as soon as they're financially capable. 

In conclusion, I stand for settling with family as the most preferable condition due to financial and relational reasons. But I do acknowledge and still respect some young adults who decide to live by themselves for they must have their own background. We can never choose in which kind of family we were born into, but we can always have a choice to build a better family of our own.

Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","#media
#interaction
#people
#society","These days, every time we turn on television or flicking through the pages of newspapers, we learn about the impact of social media. There are some concerns about whether these platforms eliminate the direct interaction between people and people or not. In this essay, I will look at its pros and cons and also draw some conclusions.

First of all, overreliance on social platforms can lead to fewer connections in the community. A large number of users are surfing TikTok, and Facebook on a daily basis, for example, because the core content is so highly addictive and occupies the majority of their time. As a result, those who sit still in front of their smartphone's screen gradually forget about family reunions. Besides, some advanced functions and applications allow FaceTime, which means that they can call and have a face chat at any time of the day. However, without meeting in person, online calling will sometimes lead to misunderstanding if the internet connection is not stable or individuals cannot grasp the innermost thoughts of others. 

On the other hand, social networks are beneficial due to their convenience. There are some features from them that can help solve the problems, especially in case of emergency. For instance, an app called Zalo in Vietnam enables people to have a group video call even though there is no WIFI nearby, which facilitates transferring the news urgently without the need to gather. In addition, long-distance relationships are truly in high demand of  support from technology to carry on online calls since they are unable to see face-to-face at that moment.

In conclusion, social media does have positives and drawbacks in daily life. Although sometimes individuals can be overattached to it hence causing fewer reactions to family and friends, I do believe that the advantages can outweigh its disadvantages owing to its flexibility and excellent support.

Initially, there is no doubt coin has an integral role in our hearts but this value has influenced our lives in a negative way since people keep struggling to earn more money while they do have not enough time to spend it;therefore, this progress should be in a balance because we need money to survive due to the life expenditure. For example, earning the amount of silver for spending monthly should be our aim instead of working overtime with a view to collecting  much of it in diverse banks and thus, this valuable paper should not take  control of our soul in a negative way. 

Secondly, there are quite a few prominent factors such as putting aside an array of time to spend with family members, paying attention to our mental along  physical health and so on. In addition, it is obvious that having a lovely conversation releases Cerotin; a hormone that makes you cheerful, a feeling that can not be purchased with money.

Despite the fact that this trend has some advantages, I would argue that there are more disadvantages. This essay will explore how the drawbacks of working overtime outweigh the benefits.

On the one hand, there are several merits of clocking out late. The principal merit is that the more employees spend time on their tasks, the more they gain experience. To explain, there are many jobs that need a lot of working hours to become a professional. For instance, Architect is one of the occupations which require a number of skills and experience. Thus, a junior designer who holds many projects and works overtime to get the jobs done is significantly promoted to be a senior designer or a director.

On the other hand, there are some demerits associated with staying until night. First and foremost is decreasing time slots for leisure activities. This means that individuals who can't manage their work to be done on time are losing their work-life balance. For example, If someone has to stay at the office until late at night, he or she won't have time to have dinner with family or exercise at the gym. Furthermore, These problems can result in mental and physical illnesses.

All things considered, I am of the opinion that though there are potential advantages, the negative effects of working long hours clearly outweigh because of lack of relaxation. Consequently, everyone should appropriately manage their amount of work.

Being creative and having hands-on social media experience can help individuals become famous.

On the other hand, it can be argued that people with extra talents, including computer science expertise, tend to have more significant potential when they enter social media platforms. For example, those with IT degrees and communication expertise can quickly become prominent if they create their own YouTube channels. Even though this suggestion can be valid, I believe that individuals who do not have an academic background can still have the prospect of becoming famous by engaging in social media channels.

In conclusion, technological improvements, such as the Internet and social media platforms, have made it easy for folk to contact many people.

On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why people would love to go to shopping malls. The principal reason is that it is a one-stop service that solves many lifestyles and is located in the middle of the city. Moreover, customers would prefer to shop indoors without going outside in tropical countries. For instance, Paragon is one of the favourite department stores in Thailand and we can find movie theatres, restaurants, retails and fitness in this single place.

On the other hand, some opponents may argue that there are a lot of expensive items in malls. The main reason for this view is that local stores provide more reasonable prices than shopping centres.Furthermore, street stores are well-known places order to their handmade products and customer's warm welcome. For example, native perfume shops are popular because of their unique fragrances and store locations which are related to their concepts.

Books are the traditional way of transferring information, still in schools, teachers are using books to teach the students as it is affordable, and one of the convenient methods through which learners can mark and concentrate on their studies. Just take an example, undergraduate can take internet assistance during their projects, but they still prefer to visit the library and read books. Because books provide reliable information and contain a mixture of knowledge. In contrast. The production of printed work is not easy as papers are manufactured from trees. Moreover, it needs a proper way of storage, if we place it in a moist or rainy environment  it will destroy its quality.

Radio and film are the favourites of the old and young generations respectively. Radio assists us in times when we are out of the Internet. It helps us refresh old memories. Due to only audio features, the younger generation tends to audio-visual devices like television or films. The prominent advantage of films is they provide colourful views and help better in learning if somebody does not like reading books. Conversely, it contains some sexual content that spoils  society. Thus, the crime rates are getting increased such as rape, murder etcetera.

In conclusion, even though  widespread technology provides access to vast information owing to its volatile nature, we cannot completely trust  it. Therefore, I think that books are a source of trustworthy information, as they connect us to the traditional and cultural values of some societies, that are missing on the Internet.

#responsibility","It is often said by some human beings that old people should be managed by the government, while others believe that it is mandatory that family should take care of them. In my opinion, the latter proportion appears to be more rational. This essay will highlight the both above-mentioned views in the upcoming paragraphs with proper explanation thus will lead to a logical Conclusion.

On the one hand, if the government does not focus on the elderly population, it will impact their lives. To elucidate it, it is mandatory that the government should provide support to people, aged above 65, whether it can be psychological or financial. A pension system, for example, should be introduced so that people cannot depend on others to fulfil their basic requirements ( clothes and medicine). As a result, this amendment represents a breeding ground for improving their quality of life.

Moving towards the latter notion, some individuals opine that family is the basic need for an aged person, as members of a family share a great bond with each other. To be more precise, the family is the one, to better understand the needs of their family member. To epitome, if any member of the family is suffering from depression then other members of the family provide psychological support by encouraging the depressed one to vent his or her feelings. Hence, aged families will surely get care from the people with whom they are surrounded. 

In conclusion, although the authority will surely help the aged one by providing finances. However, the physical and psychological needs are only fulfilled by the individuals nearer to them.

Do you agree or disagree?","#growth
#shops
#towns
#cities","Expansion of E-commerce business would lead to a significant closure of physical stores in cities and towns soon. In my opinion, I would partially agree with this statement.

To commence with the physical stores, online shopping will not be able to replace all existing shops. Firstly, there are products which need to be purchased by customer’s after reaching a shop because they need to experience the product before purchasing it. For an example: - Purchase of an Automobile by a customer would always prefer to have a test run of the product before they purchase it, which requires the existence of physical stores. Secondly, there is always a customer segment that would not be encouraged by the growth of E-commerce platform as they are more comfortable to purchase products by visiting the store. Hence, the demand for physical shops will exists.

On the other hand, E-commerce platform has created an opportunity for business to operate economically, effectively, and efficiently. The growth of online shopping recently, have led businesses to open more virtual stores in their websites, as it is lucrative. Thus, leading to an increase in the closure of outlets but not all. Furthermore, it has enabled them to reach a wider community by overcoming many challenges with ease. For an instance: - With the expansion of online shopping, businesses are now able to sell their products to a large market without investing in outlets, which allows them to operate more efficiently and economically.

In conclusion, it is important to understand that the growth of E-commerce business will lead to an increase in the closure of outlets because of the opportunities it persists but it will not lead to a discontinuation of physical stores fully.

#situation","These days, more and more professionals are choosing to relocate to more developed countries for work. This happens mainly because of a better economy and a variety of job opportunities in richer countries. This essay will explore the reasons for this trend and discuss the possible solutions.

There are some issues that provoke some employers, especially health practitioners and educators, to move abroad. Firstly, developed nations provide more facilities for these jobs, like hospitals and schools. Hence, it is easier for both teachers and doctors to find a job opportunity and even consider different places according to their preferences. Secondly, industrialised countries have better infrastructure which includes accessible transportation, and an efficient health and education system. For example, in Russia, some citizens from  small cities, such as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsh and Vladivostok, decided to move to Hong Kong and China, as these countries have a wide range of jobs with higher salaries for educators and doctors. 

Some measures can be taken in order to stop individuals from moving. If authorities of less developed nations take steps to increase the number of schools and hospitals, as well as to improve the quality of these facilities it will help to accommodate all the employees and give them a chance to choose the work they desire. Additionally,  convenient transit should be provided, so professionals can easily travel from their homes to work. Lastly, some perks and incentives should be offered to those who work locally and demonstrate loyalty to their position. For instance, in Australia, some companies provide extra bonuses in the form of money for those who have worked in their organisation for more than 10 years. 

In conclusion, it is a major problem that many individuals decide to relocate to other countries for better lives. This problem can be tackled if the government improve the quality of life in less developed nations providing more facilities for employees along with better transportation and quality of education and medical system. Moreover, promoting local jobs with bonuses and incentives can encourage individuals to work locally.

I wholeheartedly agree with the latter opinion as it plays a vital role in their growth process.

On the one hand, some people justifiably believe that what children need is greater development which is accessible by being taught as well as freedom. Not only does giving the chance to choose enhance their self-confidence but also it is a decisive factor in augmenting their prowess. For example, children who are allowed to decide what they want to wear are more likely to excel at addressing a problem as they have to choose logically or emotionally. Therefore, allocating freedom for children results in flourishing in their future.

On the other hand, another group of society argue that giving freedom to decide brings about being arrogant as these children are willing to consider their needs more important than others. However, I do not find this argument convincing since rarely does it happen that freedom through the parents' observation leads to arrogant children as they are taught that others' needs are as substantial as theirs. In addition, if they have an opportunity to experience dealing with different challenges, they will be more prosperous in the future. For instance, youths who have asked about the destination of a trip feel more valuable and responsible for the consequences of that travel.

To conclude, in my view, teenagers should be allowed to decide as it has a crucial role in their development and nurture. Moreover, parents should teach their offspring to consider every detail in their decisions and assist them to thrive.

#children
#school
#waste
#home","Many people think that children should be taught in school to recycle unused material, while others say that this training should be given at home. This article will discuss both views before a final statement.

On the one hand, the major benefit of teaching students about reusing material and avoiding junk at school is the expertise of mentors. In other words, teachers are trained professionals who can effectively communicate the principles of recycling and staying away from waste to students. Moreover, schools provide a structured and organized learning environment where children can receive formal education on various subjects, including recycling.  For example, in international-level schools like DPS, teachers use a variety of graphs and pictures to give a demonstration to younger ones so that they can understand every aspect of recycling with the help of visuals and put it into practice in their lives. Thus, providing guidance to students about recycling material and avoiding waste is beneficial.

On the other hand, progenitors play a significant role in shaping their juvenile’s values and habits. Put differently, children are more likely to adopt the behaviour of recycling and avoid using waste and carry it into adulthood when parents actively practice and teach recycling at residence . In addition, learning about recycling at home can be more flexible and adapted to individual family routines and lifestyles. Parents can give the lessons to suit the child's age and level of understanding. For instance, mentors can aware their kids about worthless goods such as plastic items, and cardboard items, which are also found  at residences, and have ceased to be used. Hence, progenitors can offer a real-world demonstration of the principles of recycling.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject, in my opinion, schools should include recycling education in their curriculum; nevertheless, parents must actively participate in teaching and practising recycling at home to their adolescents.

Why do you think this is happening?

What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?","#rubbish
#governments
#amount","More than any time in history, human beings are producing more waste products and this is increasing at a very alarming exponential rate. This essay discusses why I feel this is happening and explores the measures governments need to take to bring this under control.

There are several reasons that I believe can be attributed to the increase in rubbish in modern life. The primary reason is the growth of online shopping. Online shopping is convenient and it makes it so easy for people to purchase goods around the clock. The problem is that all these goods are packaged to ensure safe delivery before being dispatched to the consumer and as a result, all this packaging is discarded. The second reason is the change in people's lifestyles, especially those who live in cities. For instance, more and more people are eating out in restaurants and fast-food outlets, which translates into the usage of more plastic food containers and utensils which will inevitably increase the amount of non-biodegradable plastic refuse.

There are several measures governments can take to remedy this challenging issue. The most effective measure is for governments to pass laws to mandate the use of recyclable packaging. At the same time, online advertising needs to be used to encourage online shoppers to deposit used packaging in recyclable bins. Secondly, governments can introduce regulations which limit the usage of polluting products such as plastics. For example, several laws can be put in place requiring restaurants to use utensils that can be washed, sanitized and reused.

In conclusion, more garbage is being created due to the growth of online shopping and changing lifestyles. However, if governments regulate business and introduce laws to encourage more environmentally friendly practices, this can be reduced to a manageable level.

Two sides emerged: those who agree with it and those who oppose it. Both parties present solid arguments, which will be discussed below and attached with a personal opinion.

On one hand, those who praise the tax movement as a good idea are likely to originate from a country that exhibits a radical sugar problem. They see this as a solution to fix unhealthy habits and overweight individuals, believing that this will potentially enhance the lives of citizens. Countries like America, for instance, suffer from high sugar consumption, which leads to an increase in obesity in highly populated areas. With the tax reform, the number of disgusting intake will likely shrink, therefore, adopting a healthier outlook for the people.

In contrast, those who oppose the tax reform, say that this is an attack on an individual's freedom. They argue that every person has rights and that they are allowed to buy and consume as much as they desire. Consequently, by limiting that privilege, there could be damaging consequences. For example,  a sudden change like this could cause an uproar in many places; riots will ensue and protesters will take their hysteria to the streets. 

In conclusion, I personally believe that this is a positive implementation because it will shape a better image for people and for nations. However, the process should be steadily progressive; starting with smaller regulations before moving onto the primary goal of taxing. It is a messy development, but one that yields greater results.

Firstly, several businesses, SMEs in particular, that are located in the main city have not had an opportunity to move to the urban from the various problems, To illustrate further, they don’t have resources enough because the moving needs to spend an amount of money and time, moreover, a number of employees who want to generate a sustainable income in their professional life to enhance their family's well-being are not able to change their locate leading to lack of workers in the future. Furthermore, some companies are responsible for changing their suppliers because the shipments in the downtown are not suitable for someone causing more expenditure as well as the profit to decrease.

On the other hand, despite its difficulty and more expenditure, most of the NGOs that want to improve the earth require that every company are supposed to relocate because, should businesses move to other places, this will raise the demand for employment. Besides, it is able to improve the civilization in these places, For example, employers in the downtown who are hired in the old industries have an opportunity to find the new industries that are appropriate for their professional life. In addition, when urban areas have more infrastructure from investing either the company or the government leads to civilization.

In many nations around the universe, countryside individuals are transferring to urban areas, so the population in the village is decreasing. The essay describes both views and it is a negative practice with the statement from my inclination. 

To commence with, humans are always inclined to lead a happy and healthy life in a sound environment. For that process, they easily can stimulate their brain to perform any complex task. For example, scientist Neutron spent his whole life in a countryside area. Consequently, he easily focused his concentration on increasing analysis habits for innovation. In addition, food production is one of the fundamental things for surviving creatures of mankind. To continue that process, people have to invest their knowledge and ideas in the field of agriculture sectors to live in village areas. To give an example, some skilful persons can undoubtedly give time to improve how to grow paddy, rice, and maize more in a scientific way. As a result, a country can enhance its stability in a sustainable way to maintain food security.

On the other hand, many young professionals have to lead their lives in rural areas to serve illiterate people. For this reason, some people are encouraged to spend their time in the village with family.  For instance, by teaching their students, a good teacher can change the behaviour of youngsters. Therefore, one who will watch a dream how he successes in his career with great effort. Besides, a large population in city areas can create  worse environmental problems. In accordance, Dhaka is the third air air-polluted city in the world. The way of an illustration, many individuals face severe health issues such as dengue, typhoid, breathing difficulties, cancer etc. After the effects, even though some people can not get pure drinking water as well as fresh air to lead their lives. 

To conclude, one person can live with his family in a countryside area to lead a happy life. Indeed, humans have learned to survive their lives in countryside areas from the ancient period.
